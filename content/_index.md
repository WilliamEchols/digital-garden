Hey, I'm William. This is my version of what is called a [[notes/Digital Garden|Digital Garden]]. If you are unfamiliar,

> _A digital garden isÂ an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public._ [Ness labs](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up#:~:text=A%20digital%20garden%20is%20an,to%20be%20cultivated%20in%20public.)

In essence, it is a personal wiki designed for messy exploration of interlinked topics in order to prioritize effective learning.

If you were looking for my put-together and professional web presence, you can find that here: [https://people.tamu.edu/~williamechols](https://people.tamu.edu/~williamechols/#).

Explanation regarding my note taking platform can be found at [[notes/Obsidian|Obsidian]].

<center><h1>Note About Publishing</h1></center>

> I often use [[notes/MOC|MOC]]s to conveniently categorize my notes and then use [[notes/Dataview (plugin)|Dataview (plugin)]] to dynamically load notes based on their attributes; however, plugins are not (yet) web compatible so pages make appear broken. An easy solution is to use the graph view on the bottom of each note to navigate to connected pages (both links and [[notes/backlinks|backlinks]] to the current note) and also view.
