~~Dangling Links plugin~~

[[notes/Hugo|Hugo]] 
- **doesn't handle transclude `![]` correctly**
	- My only serious issue
	- Does not appear in connections graph
	- Only links (`[[]]`) work
- ~~frontmatter title, date in template~~
	- ~~Updated templates/~~
	- ~~Backlog compatibility in notes/~~
	- ~~Possible to have global default template?~~
		- ~~Templater Plugin using "/" for the template~~
- recursive ignore privates/ in config.toml
	- ~~Temp solution by manual sub-folders~~
- ~~back button (Million SPA)~~

- ~~Odd LaTeX rendering in some cases (mostly my bad, hacky LaTeX)~~
