## Problem

If $p$ is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, $\{a,b,c\}$, there are exactly three solutions for $p=120$.

$\{20,48,52\}$, $\{24,45,51\}$, $\{30,40,50\}$

For which value of $p≤1000$, is the number of solutions maximised?

## Work

```python
# takes a while but a fun use of abusing Python lists

limit = 1000

right_triangles = [a + b + c for a in range(limit) for b in range(limit) for c in range(limit) if a ** 2 + b ** 2 == c ** 2 and a + b + c <= limit]
print(max(set(right_triangles), key = right_triangles.count))
```
