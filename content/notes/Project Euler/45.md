## Problem

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Triangle||$T_{n}=n(n+1)/2$||$1,3,6,10,15,…$|
|Pentagonal||$P_{n}=n(3n−1)/2$||$1,5,12,22,35,…$|
|Hexagonal||$H_n=n(2n−1)$||$1,6,15,28,45,…$|

It can be verified that $T_{285}=P_{165}=H_{143}=40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

## Work

```python
l = 100000
tri = [n * (n + 1)/2 for n in range(2, l)]
pent = [n * (3 * n - 1)/2 for n in range(2, l)]
hex = [n * (2 * n - 1) for n in range(2, l)]

for i in tri:
    if i in pent and i in hex:
        print(int(i))
```
