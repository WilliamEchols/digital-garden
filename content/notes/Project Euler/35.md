## Problem

The number, $197$, is called a circular [[notes/prime|prime]] because all rotations of the digits: $197$, $971$, and $719$, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below $100$: $2,3,5,7,11,13,17,31,37,71,73,79$, and $97$.

How many circular primes are there below one million?
