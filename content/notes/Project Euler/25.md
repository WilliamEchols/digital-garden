## Problem

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} \text{, where } F_{1}=1 \text{ and } F_{2}=1.$

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

$$
F_{1}=1
$$
$$
F_{2}=1
$$
$$
F_{3}=2
$$
$$
F_{4}=3
$$
$$
F_{5}=5
$$
$$
F_{6}=8
$$
$$
F_{7}=13
$$
$$
F_{8}=21
$$
$$
F_{9}=34
$$
$$
F_{10}=55
$$
$$
F_{11}=89
$$
$$
F_{12}=144
$$

The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?

## Work

```python
a = 1
b = 1
i = 2

while len(str(a)) < 1000:
    a, b = b, a + b
    i += 1

print(i-1)
```
