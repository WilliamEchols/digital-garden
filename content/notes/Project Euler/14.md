## Problem

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

$$
n\to \frac{n}{2} \ (n\text{ is even})
$$
$$
n\to 3n+1 \ (n\text{ is odd})
$$

Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:$$13→40→20→10→5→16→8→4→2→1.$$It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem [[notes/Collatz Conjecture|Collatz Conjecture]]), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

**NOTE:** Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

## Work

```python
def next(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n /= 2
    else:
        n = 3 * n + 1
    return n

def length_of_collatz(n, cache):
    original_n = n
    l = 0
    while n != 1 and n >= original_n:  # if n < original_n, this sequence length has been computed
        n = next(n)
        l += 1
    cache[original_n] = l + cache.get(n, 0)  # store computed sequence length in cache
    return cache[original_n]

cache = {1: 1}
n_max, l_max = 1, 1
for i in range(2, 1000000+1):
    l = length_of_collatz(i, cache)
    if l > l_max:
        n_max, l_max = i, l
        print(n_max, l_max)

print(n_max) 
```
