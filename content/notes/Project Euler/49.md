## Problem

The arithmetic sequence, $1487,4817,8147$, in which each of the terms increases by $3330$, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are [[notes/prime|prime]], and, (ii) each of the $4$-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three $1$-, $2$-, or $3$-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other $4$-digit increasing sequence.

What $12$-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

## Work

```python
def get_primes(limit):
    return [i for i in range(2, limit) if all(i % n != 0 for n in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1))]

def order_digits(n):
    return int(''.join(sorted(str(n))))

num_digits = 4
primes_in_range = [p for p in get_primes(10 ** num_digits) if p > 10 ** (num_digits - 1)]

from collections import defaultdict
primes_dict = defaultdict(list)
for p in primes_in_range:
    primes_dict[order_digits(p)].append(p)

for primes in primes_dict.values():
    primes.sort()
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(primes)):
            diff = primes[j] - primes[i]
            if primes[j] + diff in primes:
                print(str(primes[i]) + str(primes[j]) + str(primes[j] + diff))
```
