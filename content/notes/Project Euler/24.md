## Problem

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
$$012\quad021\quad102\quad120\quad201\quad210$$
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

## Work

```python
from itertools import permutations
 
perm = permutations(['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'])

print(''.join(list(perm)[1000000-1]))
```
