## Problem

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct [[notes/prime|prime]] factors are:
$$14=2×7$$
$$15=3×5.$$
The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
$$644=2^{2}×7×23$$
$$645=3×5×43$$
$$646=2×17×19.$$
Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

## Work

```python
def get_primes(limit):
    return [i for i in range(2, limit) if all(i % n != 0 for n in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1))]

def divisible_primes(n, primes):
    smaller_primes = [p for p in primes if p <= n]
    div = []
    for p in smaller_primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            div.append(p)
    return div

def multiply_arr(arr):
    r = 1
    for n in arr:
        r *= n
    return r

primes = get_primes(10000) # artificial limit

num_prime_divisors = []
for i in range(2, 1000000): # artificial limit
    num_prime_divisors.append(divisible_primes(i, primes))
    if len(num_prime_divisors) > 4:
        if len(num_prime_divisors[-1]) == 4 and len(num_prime_divisors[-2]) == 4 and len(num_prime_divisors[-3]) == 4 and len(num_prime_divisors[-4]) == 4:
            print(multiply_arr(num_prime_divisors[-4]))
            break
```
