## Problem

  
$145$ is a curious number, as $1!+4!+5!=1+24+120=145$.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: As $1!=1$ and $2!=2$ are not sums they are not included.

## Work

```python
def factorial(n):
    multiple = 1
    while n:
        multiple *= n
        n -= 1
    return multiple

def sum_of_own_factorial(n):
    sum = 0
    for char in str(n):
        sum += factorial(int(char))
    return n == sum

sum = 0
n = 3
for i in range(1000000):
    sum += n if sum_of_own_factorial(n) else 0
    n += 1

print(sum)
```
