## Problem

By listing the first six [[notes/prime|prime]] numbers: $2,3,5,7,11,$ and $13,$ we can see that the $6$th prime is $13$.

What is the $10001$st prime number?

## Work

```python
l = 100

sum_squares = sum([i**2 for i in range(1, l+1)])

square_sum = sum([i for i in range(1, l+1)]) ** 2

diff = square_sum - sum_squares

print(diff)
```
