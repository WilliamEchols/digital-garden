## Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,…$$
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Work

```python
def fib_even_sum(limit):
    a = 1
    b = 0
    sum = 0
    while (a <= limit):
        c = a
        a += b
        b = c
        if (a % 2 == 0):
            sum += a
    return sum

print(fib_even_sum(4000000))
```
