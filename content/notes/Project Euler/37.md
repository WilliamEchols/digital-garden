## Problem

The number $3797$ has an interesting property. Being [[notes/prime|prime]] itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: $3797$, $797$, $97$, and $7$. Similarly we can work from right to left: $3797$, $379$, $37$, and $3$.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ are not considered to be truncatable primes.

## Work

```python
# honestly, I just need to write a function/utility file for functions like this
def get_primes(limit):
    primes = [i+1 for i in range(limit)]
    primes = [i for i in range(2, limit) if all(i % n != 0 for n in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1))]

    return primes

def d(n, primes):
    for i in range(1, len(str(n))):
        if int(str(n)[i:]) not in primes or int(str(n)[:-i]) not in primes:
            return False
    return True

limit = 1000
primes_w_property = []
while len(primes_w_property) < 11: # computationally wasteful and re-running the same 10% recursively
    primes = get_primes(limit)
    primes_w_property = [p for p in primes if d(p, primes) and p > 7]
    limit *= 10
    print("bumped limit to", limit)
print(sum(primes_w_property))
```
