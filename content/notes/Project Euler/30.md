## Problem

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
$$  
\begin{array} \\
1634=1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4 \\
8208=8^4+2^4+0^4+8^4 \\
9474 = 9^4+4^4+7^4+4^4
\end{array}
$$
As $1=1^4$ is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is $1634+8208+9474=19316$.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

## Work

```python
def sum_fifth_digit_power(n):
    sum = 0
    for c in str(n):
        sum += int(c) ** 5
    return sum

def f(n):
    return n == sum_fifth_digit_power(n)

sum = 0
for i in range(2, 10000000): # not sure of/don't care to find the best way to calculate a ceiling so this should do
    if f(i):
        sum += i

print(sum)
```
