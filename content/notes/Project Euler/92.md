## Problem

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,
$$44→32→13→10→\mathbf{1}→\mathbf{1}$$
$$85→\mathbf{89}→145→42→20→4→16→37→58→\mathbf{89}$$
Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?

## Work

```python
# 3 possible approaches
# 1) try to determine the conditions that lead to 89 (work backwards)
# 2) try to determine the conditions that lead to 1 (i.e. do not lead to 89)
# 3) brute force calculate each starting number < 10,000,000

# brute force approach (slow)


def step(n):
    return sum([int(c) ** 2 for c in str(n)])

# in reality you should keep track of what previously calculated numbers end in 1 and 89 and then once one of those is reached, you know the end of your current calculation
# you could model with a linked list, for example
# 

num_89_loop = 0
for i in range(2, 10000000):
    while not (step(i) == 1 or step(i) == 89):
        i = step(i)
    if step(i) == 89:
        num_89_loop += 1

print(num_89_loop)
```
