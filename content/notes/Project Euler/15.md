## Problem

Starting in the top left corner of a $2×2$ grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a $20×20$ grid?

## Work

```python
# this is much more of a math problem than a CS problem
# I did some reading and it looks like the answer should be in the form of (2n!)/(n! * n!) for n sides
# to be honest, I don't really understand this one but it has to do with n options of either down or right

def f(n):
    f = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        f *= i
    return f

print(int(f(40)/(f(20)*f(20))))
```
