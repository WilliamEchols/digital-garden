## Problem

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September,  
    April, June and November.  
    All the rest have thirty-one,  
    Saving February alone,  
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.  
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

## Work

```python
num_sundays_first_day_of_month = -1

def step_one_day(date):
    global num_sundays_first_day_of_month
    # day of week
    date["day_of_week"] = date["day_of_week"] % 7 + 1

    # determine # days in current month
    days_in_current_month = -1
    if date["month"] in [4, 6, 9, 11]:
        days_in_current_month = 30
    elif date["month"] in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:
        days_in_current_month = 31
    elif date["month"] in [2]:
        days_in_current_month = 29 if ((date["year"] % 100 == 0 and date["year"] % 400 == 0) or (date["year"] % 100 != 0 and date["year"] % 4 == 0)) else 28

    # increment day
    if date["day"] < days_in_current_month:
        date["day"] = date["day"] + 1
    else:
        # increment month
        date["day"] = 1

        # increment year
        if date["month"] < 12:
            date["month"] = date["month"] + 1
        else:
            date["month"] = 1
            date["year"] = date["year"] + 1

    return date

date = { "day": 1, "month": 1, "year": 1901, "day_of_week": 1 }
print("initial date:\n", date, "\n\n")

while (not (date["day"] == 31 and date["month"] == 12 and date["year"] == 2000)):
    date = step_one_day(date)
    if date["day"] == 1 and date["day_of_week"] == 7:
        num_sundays_first_day_of_month += 1

print("final date:\n", date, "\n\n")
print("num sundays:", num_sundays_first_day_of_month)
```
