## Problem

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Work

```python
def sum_of_multiples(divisor_list, limit):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, limit):
        for divisor in divisor_list:
            if i % divisor == 0:
	            sum += i
                break
    return sum

print(sum_of_multiples([3, 5], 1000))
```
