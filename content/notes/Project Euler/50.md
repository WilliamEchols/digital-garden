## Problem

The [[notes/prime|prime]] $41$, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:$$41=2+3+5+7+11+13.$$This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains $21$ terms, and is equal to $953$.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

## Work

```python
def get_primes(limit):
    primes = [i for i in range(2, limit) if all(i % n != 0 for n in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1))]
    return primes

limit = 1000000
primes = get_primes(limit)
primes_set = set(primes)

max_length = 0
max_prime = 0

for i in range(len(primes)):
    sum = 0
    for j in range(i, len(primes)):
        sum += primes[j]
        if sum > limit: 
            break
        if sum in primes_set and j - i + 1 > max_length: 
            max_length = j - i + 1
            max_prime = sum

print(max_prime)
```
