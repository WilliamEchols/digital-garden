## Problem

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7^{th}$ triangle number would be $1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28$. The first ten terms would be:
$$1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,…$$
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

$$\mathbf{1}:1$$
$$\mathbf{3}:1,3$$
$$\mathbf{6}:1,2,3,6$$
$$\mathbf{10}:1,2,5,10$$
$$\mathbf{15}:1,3,5,15$$
$$\mathbf{21}:1,3,7,21$$
$$\mathbf{28}:1,2,4,7,14,28$$

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Work

```python
import math

def num_divisors(num):
    num_div = 0
    root = int(math.sqrt(num))
    for i in range(1, root + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            num_div += 2 if num != i * i else 1
    return num_div

n = 1
t = 0
while True:
    t += n
    d = num_divisors(t)
    if d > 500:
        print(t)
        break
    n += 1
```
