## Problem

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$
1^2+2^2+\dots+10^2=385.
$$
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025.$$
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025−385=2640$.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Work

```python
l = 100

sum_squares = sum([i**2 for i in range(1, l+1)])

square_sum = sum([i for i in range(1, l+1)]) ** 2

diff = square_sum - sum_squares

print(diff)
```
