## Problem

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a [[notes/prime|prime]] and twice a square.

$$9=7+2×1^{2}$$
$$15=7+2×2^{2}$$
$$21=3+2×3^{2}$$
$$25=7+2×3^{2}$$
$$27=19+2×2^{2}$$
$$33=31+2×1^{2}$$

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
