Create tasks accessible from any file with support for priorities, start/end dates, sorting, in-progress state, and reoccurring tasks. (I recommend creating tasks in daily notes and creating a table in a dashboard/homepage note to organize/set status of tasks)

View a clean table of tasks due this week

```tasks
not done
due after today
due before in one week
sort by due
short mode
hide edit button
hide backlink
```

Creating a complex task with (in order) title, end date, start date, assigned date, repetition schedule, and created date (although you can add as much or as little as you want and the UI will do the heavy lifting)
