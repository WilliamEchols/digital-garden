Like many others, I have been reflecting recently over the time of consuming content online. Quite a lot of people have tried quite a lot of strategies to reduce their time spent online; however, there is also a lot to learn from online resources so I want to find a compromise to find the sweet spot.

I have been using [[notes/Obsidian Plugins|Obsidian Plugins]] to test different content reading and note taking strategies with significant success and while experimenting with an RSS Feeds plugin I had an idea- could I set up my RSS Feeds in such a way that my only interface with the internet was through preselected, tailor picked RSS feeds? This way, I could still gather my useful information- and allow for some entertainment- without the distractions and endless doom-scrolling. 

In practice, this is difficult due to school work so I can't enforce a network firewall restriction to force myself to stick to it, but I think the approach could still be helpful.
