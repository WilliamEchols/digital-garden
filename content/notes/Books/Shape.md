# Shape

# Notes

Surprisingly well executing, entertaining, and seamless dabbling connecting logic, Abraham Lincoln, Topology, Physics, Malaria, Probability, Financial Markets, and much more.

As an additional note, I was initially worried that this book would turn into a rant for whatever political/ideological/philosophical beliefs that the author may hold as so many other books have, but I was pleasantly surprised by the neutral and masterful handling of opinionated topics.
