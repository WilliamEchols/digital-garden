A digital garden is loosely defined by nature, but in essence, its a relatively relaxed and personal approach to notes. 

A much better explanation of the history and practice can be found here: [maggieappleton.com/garden-history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

For my own use case, my notes are mostly about Mathematics, Computer Science, and thinking. I use [[notes/Obsidian|Obsidian]] for note taking.
