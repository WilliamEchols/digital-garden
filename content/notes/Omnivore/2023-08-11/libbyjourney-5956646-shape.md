Thus we see that one can provide a short proof, even if finding that proof takes a long time",

Suppose you want to produce a passage of text with the same statistical properties as written English, and it starts with ON. Then you can use a random number generator to select the next letter; there should be a 14.7% chance it is S, an 11.3% chance it is T, and so on. Having chosen your next letter (T, say), you have your next bigram (NT) and you can proceed as before, as long as you like",
