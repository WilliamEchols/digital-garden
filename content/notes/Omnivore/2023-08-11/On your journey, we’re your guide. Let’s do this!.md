Hello there,

I remember what it was like to start my own business online. It was like a new adventure, filled with excitement and wonder about what treasures might lie ahead … but I was also _constantly_ worried and confused:

* Is this even going to work?
* Am I just wasting my time?
* What direction do I go down?
* What if I become a complete failure?

​  
It was a constant push and pull, mentally. Every time I felt discouraged I just said to myself, “I wish this was easy.”

_Can you relate?_

For over a decade, I’ve helped tens of thousands of motivated people like you find direction and create life-changing businesses. 

The one thing they all had in common? 

_Obstacles!_ 

I haven’t met one creator or entrepreneur who hasn’t faced significant obstacles.

But there’s a big difference between those who give up on their dreams and those who persevere.

The difference is having the right support to help you through the obstacles you face. At SPI, we help you with those obstacles in several different ways.

## Get Unstuck

Every week, we send you the _Unstuck_ newsletter, which brings you a story and a related challenge that is specifically designed to help you overcome a specific obstacle. Read the story and take the challenge to break through what is holding you back.

_Unstuck_ comes out every Tuesday. Along with the weekly story, you'll also find links to upcoming events at SPI, a cool sponsor we think you'll like, and my Dad Joke of the Week. Trust me, you don't want to miss it.

## Together Is Better

When you signed up to connect with me and the SPI team we asked you an important question: 

**What’s your #1 challenge** _**right now**_ **when it comes to online business?** 

This is _your_ first step on this new pathway, and our first step in knowing how to best serve and guide you. So, if you didn’t answer already, here it is:

**What is the biggest thing getting in your way from achieving your business goals?** 

Answering this question helps us tailor the advice we send you to your business needs. 

​

If you’re like many entrepreneurs, you’re drawn to the freedom that entrepreneurship offers.

Freedom to do what you want, when you want, with who you want. It doesn’t require a million-dollar business or millions of subscribers to achieve. It requires a clear direction, support from the right people, and _access to help when you need it_. 

And that’s exactly what SPI offers. Our company is built on the idea that **together is better.** 

When there are more people working toward a common goal, _everyone_ is more likely to achieve it. Science proves it, and the results from our own students do too.

## Free Content and Events

SPI’s content, courses, and communities equip entrepreneurs like you with the best resources in the world to find your way to success, and it all starts today.
