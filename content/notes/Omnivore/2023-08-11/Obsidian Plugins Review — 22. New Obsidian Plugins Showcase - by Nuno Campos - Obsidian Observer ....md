Obsidian just released a couple of days ago a new core plugin: Properties.

It’s a new way to manage our notes’ metadata, in both Live Preview and Reading modes.

You can easily add a new property from the `+ Add property` button, from the note’s top tree dot menu, or from the command palette.

A property can be of type Text, List, Number, Checkbox, Date, or Time. You can change the type by clicking on the property icon. When you’re editing a property's value, suggestions will show up based on the other notes' properties’ values.

You can even insert links in a property.
