Hi there,

 I've recorded **a 2-minute video** to officially welcome you and tell you more about the Forte Labs newsletter:

​

From now on, **you'll receive my very best content** on how you can build a Second Brain, enhance your productivity, and live a more meaningful life in your inbox every Tuesday.

When I started this newsletter, I also consciously decided **what you WON'T be receiving from me:**

And that's the same old superficial tips and tricks on how to "hustle 24/7."

If you're looking for more than the same tired advice endlessly recycled, you've come to the right place.

**I believe in**[**human-centered work**](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vuknovvnwsgu73602alhwnwwk55/dphehmuqne0op9im/aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3J0ZWxhYnMuY28vYmxvZy9hLW1hbmlmZXN0by1vZi1odW1hbi1jZW50ZXJlZC13b3JrLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJ3ZWxjb21lJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVkdWNhdGlvbg==) – the possibility of work as a self-expression full of learning, wonder, and enjoyment.

I don't believe that productivity is just a way of mindlessly checking more boxes. It is a means of creating more value in the world for yourself and others.

So I'll be sending you essays, videos, and exclusive event invites around topics such as personal knowledge management, productivity, learning, habit formation, personal effectiveness, and self-awareness.

By exploring new ideas and experimenting with new ways of thinking, we'll uncover a whole new level of human performance based on fundamental principles. 

**Sound good?** 
**​**

Now, here’s what you can do right now to get started… 

## Step #1: Subscribe to our YouTube channel 

Almost every week, [we’re posting new videos](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vuknovvnwsgu73602alhwnwwk55/n2hohqun7nzrn5t6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vYy9UaWFnb0ZvcnRlTGFicy8%5Fc3ViX2NvbmZpcm1hdGlvbj0x) on productivity, personal knowledge management, creativity, and what it means to live a meaningful life. 

You’ll also find collaborations with other thought leaders in the productivity and PKM space. 

## Step #2: Let’s get social 

​[Twitter](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vuknovvnwsgu73602alhwnwwk55/25h2h9u7m50ov7t3/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9pbnRlbnQvdXNlcj9zY3JlZW5fbmFtZT1mb3J0ZWxhYnM=) is where I’m thinking out loud, sharing new things and topics I’m exploring. 

If Twitter is not your thing, you can also join me on [LinkedIn](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vuknovvnwsgu73602alhwnwwk55/z2hgh7uonx2wdqup/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2luL3RpYWdvZm9ydGUv), [Instagram](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vuknovvnwsgu73602alhwnwwk55/48hvh7u0x04g0nbx/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9mb3J0ZWxhYnNjby8=), or [Facebook](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vuknovvnwsgu73602alhwnwwk55/wnh2h6ur0regrof7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2ZvcnRlbGFicw==) to get all updates from us. 

## Step #3: Tell me about yourself 

I’d love to get to know you better. Why did you subscribe to the newsletter? How can I help you on your journey? What are you looking to achieve? 

Just hit reply to this email and let me know. 

​

One more thing before you go...

I recommend adding hello@fortelabs.com to your address book so my emails don't end up in spam and moving this email to your “Important” tab.

I'll see you soon in your inbox,

Tiago

​

P.S. I asked you above to tell me more about yourself. **So it’s only fair that you also get to know me a little better, isn’t it?** 

Tomorrow, I’ll share the personal story that kicked off the whole Second Brain movement.
