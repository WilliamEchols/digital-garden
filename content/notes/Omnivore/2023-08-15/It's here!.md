The day has arrived..._The PARA Method_ is now available everywhere books are sold!

I haven't found any organizing technique or approach that's more powerful in a shorter amount of time than PARA. **It can transform your relationship with digital information in LITERALLY seconds.**

I've packed everything I've learned about how to implement PARA successfully – guidelines, best practices, do's and don'ts, examples, case studies – into this mini-book so you don't have to rely on trial-and-error as I did.

The book is shorter, only about 1/3 the size of _Building a Second Brain_, and filled with colorful illustrations and stand-out quotes to make it as easy to understand as possible. **You can read it in just about two hours.** 

If you've found the concept of knowledge management compelling and want to give it a try for yourself, there's no better place to begin than by organizing the ideas and knowledge you already have lying around.

When you **order your copy before next Tuesday**, you'll automatically get some **exclusive bonuses:**

**Pre-order 1 book to get…**

* The PARA Cheat Sheet, a handy printable reminder of the main principles and rules
* PARA Wallpapers for your phone, tablet, and desktop

**Pre-order 3 or more books to get…**

* The PARA Cheat Sheet & PARA Wallpapers
* A guided video tour of my personal PARA system and how I use it in my writing, business, and daily life

​

Then, [submit your receipt](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmun82mm8esmh06er82s6hdzdd400/25h2h9u20d9wweb3/aHR0cHM6Ly9haXJ0YWJsZS5jb20vc2hyUmlOUFZHUXZ2ckdxbmo=) to claim your bonuses.

## **BASB 101: How to Organize Information Within Individual Projects**

---

_(This is an answer to one of the most frequently asked questions about PARA. To get 19 more answers, go to the back of the book where you can find the link to the bonus FAQs.)_ 

When it comes to your personal information, I don’t recommend organizing the individual notes, files, documents, and other content related to a single project. 

**That time and effort is much better spent actually moving the project forward.**

Instead, I recommend you keep your projects so small that no “internal” organization is needed. 

In fact, I use this as a rule of thumb for when it’s time to break down a project into smaller ones. When it grows so large that I begin to feel the need to create more internal structure, that is a sign that one large project needs to be broken down into two or three smaller ones.

## Implementing the PARA Method in Apple Notes

---

I want to show you another example of what PARA looks like in practice. This time, in Apple's free, default notetaking app that's available on all Apple devices. 

**You'll see how I've organized Apple Notes according to Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives, and how I decide in which category a new note goes.** 

If you're using (or planning to use) Apple Notes as your Second Brain, check out this new video.
