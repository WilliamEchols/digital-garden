One of my favorite journaling questions is:

**What feels like cheating?**

Now, you can rest assured that I never violate any moral principles.

(Well, maybe a _white lie_ here and there to get my kids to behave.)

The answers vary.

I think about our **company's 30 hour work weeks** (and unlimited vacation). Thanks to intentional system design, transparent norms and a strong culture of one-on-ones, we work to live, not live to work.

I think about **surfing** \- and how I get to exercise, have fun, soak in the vitamin D and hang out with the homies every day.

And I think about **a simple ritual** to focus you precisely on what produces the highest ROI in terms of profit, impact and happiness.

## The Weekly Review: The keystone habit that makes everything better

Over a decade ago I started implementing a simple weekly habit.

You know, this 25 minute activity helped me in so many different ways. Imagine if each week you:

* Ensured you were completing the **pesky "Important, not Urgent"**
* Ruthlessly prioritized your **highest-leverage work**
* Evaluated how you **allocated your time**
* Achieved peace of mind that you **are on the right track**

**â€‹**

That, my friend - **is the Weekly Review.**

But there's a rub. During a recent workshop, we surveyed 80+ RadReaders on this practice. **Only 14% conducted a regular Weekly Review.**

And I get it. It's a hard habit to start. And an even harder one to maintain.

I fall off the wagon all the time.

But here's what I've learned about Weekly Reviews in the past decade of coaching and teaching high-performing knowledge workers:

**You make the process too complicated.**

I want to introduce you to a framework that is deceptively simple.

A framework that works. 

**And that can be completed in less than 25 minutes.**

(And I know a thing or two about the practice. At least that's what the Wall Street Journal thinks ðŸ˜‰)
