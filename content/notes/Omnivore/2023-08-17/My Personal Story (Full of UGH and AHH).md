Hello, it's Pat here.

I know how frustrating it can be to feel like you've tried everything but just can't seem to make your online business work.

It makes you wonder, “is this even worth it?”

Trust me, that’s a dark spiral to go down… one I’ve been down before. 

To keep this email short, I’ll share with you the one thing I think about each time I feel that way:

My Why.

Your Why might be different from my Why, but for me, it was my family.

I wanted to create an online business so that I could spend more time with my family and never feel financially pressured again.

That’s the thought that kept me going.

At first, working on the business took time away from the family, and as you know, sometimes you're not getting paid for the hard work you're putting in—at least not at first.

What helped me the most on my journey was the support of others.

I joined online communities and found mentors who helped me learn the ropes, overcome obstacles, and encouraged me when I felt like giving up.

It was the fast track to finally getting the success I wanted: the secret sauce.

Because of others—because of the power of community—my online business has grown beyond my wildest dreams.

I've been able to build a thriving community of followers, create multiple income streams, and have the freedom to live life on my terms.

That's why team SPI created the All-Access Pass, a groundbreaking approach to online education combining our course library with a supportive community. Plus, we added in custom pathways to keep you pushing forward toward your goals without getting overwhelmed.

Stay awesome, and we’ll see you on the inside! Cheers!

— Pat Flynn
