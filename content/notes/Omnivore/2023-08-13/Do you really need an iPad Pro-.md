Yesterday, we introduced you to the $10K Work matrix.

And today, you’ll meet **$10 Tim.**

Now we all have our friends who are obsessed with their gadgets.

(Ahem, I’m clearly deflecting my own issues.)

And if there’s something **$10 Tim** knows well, it’s **shiny new toys.**

Tim’s **Whoop Strap** monitors his Heart Rate Variability. (Cost, $360/year)

His **Peloton** provides on-demand HIIT workouts to lower his blood pressure and give him the energy to keep up with his toddlers. ($1,895 + $468/year)

His **Oura Ring** promises an orderly wind down at 9:45 PM. ($399)

And his **iPad Pro** (with _Pencil_ and _Smart Folio Keyboard_, of course) makes him a creative powerhouse. ($1,799 + $149 + $249).

**There’s just one problem.**

It’s way past Tim’s bedtime. He’s doomscrolling TikTok on his brand new iPad.

(And his Oura ring is uncharged.)

## **We’re suckers for Shiny New Toy Syndrome (SNTS)**

Deep inside, you and I know that no app, cool notebook, course (yes, _even Supercharge Your Productivity_) or wearable will give you more than 24 hours in a day, make you lose 10 pounds or make a tough decision for you.

Yet, like $10 Tim, we can’t resist.

We **smash** that buy button.

And then whisper to ourselves:

This time will be different.

**But they never are.**

## **How to overcome Shiny New Toy Syndrome**

Here’s why the Oura Ring **won’t make you sleep more** and why the Superhuman app **won’t make your boss less annoying over email.**

A tool – **any tool** (including our flagship course [Supercharge Your Productivity](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5uxrzmx95s0uvg0ezt8h7z77022/reh8hoh0905kens6/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYWRyZWFkcy5jby9zdXBlcmNoYXJnZS15b3VyLXByb2R1Y3Rpdml0eQ==)) used in isolation **is guaranteed to fail.**

Let’s say $10 Tim wanted to improve his sleep.

I mean, he’s already got the Oura Ring. But he could also splurge on a fancy _Smart Mattress_ from 8 Sleep. (Price = $2,000).

Or, he could apply the **$10K Flywheel** and understand how to **conquer Shiny New Toy Syndrome** once and for all.

Here's how it looks like if we apply the $10K Flywheel to sleeping better.

It all starts with **self-awareness.**

* Do you know how to talk to your _inner critic?_ This helps dampen nerves before a big presentation and often makes the difference between a restful sleep and a night of tossing and turning.  
​
* Do you know how to separate your identity from your self-worth? (Friend, it’s taken me decades to realize that this was an unrecognized source of personal anxiety.)  
​
* Do you know how to resolve conflict with your better half? Maybe a "never go to bed angry" rule can defuse the inevitable relationship strife.

​

Then we can identify the **three key behavior changes**:

* Shutting down your phone (a complete power down) at 8pm – 90 minutes before your bedtime.  
​
* Limiting your weekday wine consumption to 1 glass per evening, twice a week.  
​
* Closing “open loops” (GTD-style) into your notebook to prevent your mind from racing in bed.  
​

Now we get to that $2,000 Eight Sleep mattress.

That's the tool.

**The icing on the cake,** to get you those 8 _delicious_ hours of sleep.

And thanks to the $10K Flywheel, here's what RadReaders do to Shiny New Toy Syndrome:

Now it's your turn, my friend. This is a safe space. **Hit reply** and tell us:

_What is your Shiny New Toy?_

Mine is fancy Japanese notebooks, specifically the _Midori Unruled A4 Paper pads._ And lots of iPads.

With gratitude,
