Hello there,

Recently, you told us your biggest obstacle when it comes to growing your online business, and you definitely were not alone with your answer. With that said, I’m about to share with you the #1 struggle most people responded with, and it’s probably one you have experienced in some capacity, too. 

I know I have. 

What is it?

**Too many distractions and procrastination.** 

![Too many distractions 35.9%; Not enough time 23.2%; I'm too overwhelmed 19.6%; I'm missing some knowledge or key skills 15.4%; I can't get motivated 5.8%](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/570x0,shrSkoZiawK2zaWGpWz_xqpJ_wMmv4r4oxkhHWuOECNY/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/bXy9qJJZ74AD9RcM9kraEq/r3KSvw86qg735gmc85JXKc/email)

As you can see, nearly 40 percent of respondents have told us that distractions are their biggest challenge. It’s a constant battle most people have when trying something new and stepping outside of their comfort zones. 

In Stephen Pressfield’s book, _The War of Art_, he talks about the self-sabotage we bring upon ourselves as creatives when things start to get tough. 

Creating something is like growing a tree. The bigger the tree we try to grow, the larger the shadow that comes along with it. 

But self-doubt, and the fear that comes along with it, is a sign that there’s something great on the other end. 

It’s a test to see how much you want it, and you can pass by learning to focus and prioritize your work toward the goal… or you can fail by giving up.

If you’re dealing with procrastination right now, here are two tips:

1. F.O.C.U.S. = Follow One Course Until Success. We all tend to say yes to or try too many things at once. Trust me, I did it too. But I’ve learned that less is more in online business. Pick one thing, focus on it, learn as you stumble forward, and actually give it a chance to succeed. Spread yourself too thin, and nothing will even have a chance to succeed.
2. Prioritize. Even if you have a lot to do, prioritize your to-do list so you focus on the items that have the biggest impact. Set specific time aside on your calendar to focus on each item and do your best to honor that time. I call this “time-blocking,” and it’s absolutely the best way to get things done and keep boundaries around your commitments.

Lastly, the best thing you can do is surround yourself with other people like you. People who are set on achieving the same goals. That's why we ask everyone new here the question about the type of business that they run.

**What kind of business do you have, or are looking to start?**
