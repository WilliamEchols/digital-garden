Hello there,

I want to introduce you to Maria Failla.

Her journey from podcast hobbyist to full-time plant business owner is a perfect example of the transformational power of entrepreneurship.

She started a podcast called _Bloom & Grow Radio_ as a hobby to share her love of plants with others. As her podcast grew in popularity, so did her passion for helping others learn about indoor gardening. She saw an opportunity to turn her hobby into a business and took it.

It wasn’t “push-button” easy, though—it never is. 

Here are four specific challenges Maria faced while she was building her business. I’m sure you can relate.

1. **Finding the right target audience:** Maria had to go through trial and error to find the ideal audience for her podcast, _Bloom & Grow Radio_. Initially, she targeted plant lovers but soon realized that her audience was made up of plant _killers_ who wanted to learn how to keep their plants alive.
2. **Monetizing:** Initially, Maria had no plan to monetize her podcast, but she eventually realized it was possible through sponsorships and affiliate marketing. However, it took time and effort to build up her audience before she could attract sponsors.
3. **Time management:** As a solopreneur, Maria had to juggle multiple tasks, including recording, editing, and promoting her podcast, as well as managing her online store.
4. **Overcoming self-doubt:** Maria had moments of self-doubt and imposter syndrome, where she felt she wasn't qualified to host a podcast or run a business. She had to overcome these feelings and remind herself that she had valuable knowledge and experience to share with her audience.

Do any of those sound familiar to you? 

If yes, then you’re in the right place.
