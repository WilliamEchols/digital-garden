Here's the truth, : many people who have started this journey have already turned around and gone the other way. 

They start reading a bit here and there, even listening to a podcast or two, but once they imagine having to actually take some action, they retreat back to where they came from. 

But not you.

You’re still here.

You're reading this email and determined to make this work, which means_you pass._

_Pass? Pass what?_

You’ve passed the first test. 

You’ve been open about your struggles, but 

* you haven’t turned around,
* you’ve opened this email,
* and you’re ready for more.

​  
It’s a small win, but that’s how it starts before it can grow into something bigger.

Your next step: join us in one of our upcoming networking events.

It’s free, but it’ll set the tone for what we’re about, and you’ll be able to interact with us in real-time, ask questions, and get a feel for what this community is like. 

We’re very lucky. 

We always seem to attract the right kind of people who are here for the right reasons. We’re not about wealth and fame, we’re about building a successful business, one that you can be proud of, and one that supports the lifestyle _you_ want. 

And when you get together with other people who share the same vision... magic can happen. 

So join us in one of our upcoming networking events. You can participate as much or as little as you’d like, but you’ll soon find out the power of reaching a common goal, together with others, and with our guidance and support.
