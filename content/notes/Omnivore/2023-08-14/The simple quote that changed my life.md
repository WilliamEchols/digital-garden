2 days ago, I shared with you the personal story that got me started building a Second Brain…

And how I discovered that **this system could be used to solve almost any problem and accomplish any goal.** 

If you’ve missed it, you might want to search your inbox for an email with the subject line “The story of my Second Brain.”

Go ahead and do that now. I can wait! 

…

Great, you’re back! 

Now that you’re all caught up, let me tell you **the story of the simple quote that changed my life** (and how it can change yours, too). 

​

When I was 26, I moved to San Francisco for a new job – a Project Analyst position at a small consulting agency in the heart of Silicon Valley. 

I quickly immersed myself in the fast-paced world of consulting, jumping to serve the needs of large corporate clients depending on us to advance their innovation efforts.

I worked on projects for the City of San Francisco, AT&T, Columbia University, the French postal service, and Toys “R” Us. **These were some of the most interesting experiences of my life,** introducing me to countless new ideas, approaches, and ways of thinking and working.

This was at the beginning of the “coworking space” trend, and the agency was located in one of the earliest such spaces in downtown San Francisco. I sat amidst teams from innovative young startups and got to know them over lunch. They introduced me to yet another world of “lean startups” and “failing fast” that further transformed how I saw productivity.

**But after about a year, I began to burn out.** I couldn’t handle the long workdays, the last-minute urgent client requests, and the frenetic pace of communication with people across many time zones. I saw that something needed to change.

It was around this time that I first started reading books on “personal productivity.” I picked up _Getting Things Done_ by David Allen after seeing it on a friend’s bookshelf. On one of the first pages, I encountered a quote that changed my life:

_**“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”**_

Once it sunk in, I realized this was the complete opposite of everything I had ever been taught. School had taught me to memorize facts and regurgitate them on command. College had taught me to “use my head” and spend countless hours cramming from textbooks. The workplace had taught me to do “brainstorms” and think of “good ideas” at the drop of a hat.

I had always had a good imagination, fueled by my extensive reading. But I also had a terrible memory and was never very quick on my feet, which led me to think I was stupid. The way my mind worked didn’t seem to fit any of the traditional definitions of intelligence I was presented with.

**This quote taught me a new way of looking at my own brain: as a generator of new thoughts and ideas** while leaving the job of preserving them to someone else. 

I was finally discovering that my brain wasn’t meant to remember things. It was meant to imagine, to wonder, to dream, to run after spontaneous interests without a care in the world.

I took this new attitude back to my job, and **it soon transformed the way I worked.**

Every email I sent to a colleague, every presentation for my team, every brief sent to a contractor, and every client proposal – I began to see each of these artifacts as evergreen building blocks that I could collect and reuse over time.

And as I began working with these building blocks, I had another epiphany: **a modern piece of work isn’t created from scratch; it’s assembled.**

If we committed to creating a new website, we would always begin by assembling all the needed material: photos, text, colors, graphics, calls to action, links to other sites, and interactive elements. It made no sense to begin building the website until most of these pieces were ready.

And everything we create is like this. Modern work has become so complex and multi-disciplinary that we virtually never sit down to create from nothing. We start by _assembling_ building blocks and only then are we ready to begin putting them together.

Eventually, I put in place the third and final piece of the puzzle: if I was going to be creating and assembling these building blocks for the foreseeable future, I needed a pipeline – a place to store and organize my “content” over time. 

Like a staging area for ideas, **we all need a trusted place outside our head where the accumulated sum of our past thinking** (plus the thinking of others) can be laid out and prepared for use.

Where do you think you’re going to find all the building blocks you need if you don’t take the time to assemble them beforehand?

I turned to the digital notes I had been keeping since my medical condition years before and began to expand on that initial use case. I began to save everything that might be useful for future content I might one day create: online research, interesting facts, informative diagrams, evocative photos, customer feedback, and so much more.

You’re already consuming the equivalent of 30 gigabytes of information every day. All you have to do is divert 1% of that raging river into a little reservoir of your own making. 

**That’s your Second Brain: a single, centralized repository of your most valuable knowledge to fuel your future endeavors.**

So, how do you start building a Second Brain? I’m glad you asked…

I put together a free 6-day email course which I call the Second Brain Quickstart Guide. 

**It will introduce you to the basic principles and core components of a Second Brain.**
