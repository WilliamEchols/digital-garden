Hello there,

You’re here to launch a new online business or grow an existing one. But there’s likely one thing getting in the way. Everyone is different, and I’m curious what that hurdle is for you. 

Did something come to mind just now?

Is it a particular distraction or perhaps a lack of time? Maybe it’s feeling overwhelmed or even a sense of laziness? Or perhaps you think you lack the skills and knowledge to get started?

You can relate, right?

My advice is simple:

Here’s a little advice for each of the most common reasons for not giving your entrepreneurial goals a fair chance:

Time: You must make the work you’re doing toward building an online business a priority. It doesn’t have to be the #1 priority, but it must be a priority for you to dedicate time to it and honor it intentionally. 

Distraction: Prioritize. Even if you have a lot to do, prioritize your to-do list so you focus on the items that have the biggest impact first. Set specific time aside on your calendar to focus on each item and do your best to honor that time.

Overwhelm: Break bigger goals into smaller ones, prioritize so you know what to work on first, and do your best to honor the time you set aside for those items.

Motivation: The consistent solution has an accountability partner or even partners to keep you pushing ahead. No matter what level you’re at in your business, it’s so much easier to keep going when you have others who genuinely understand, rooting for you, and keeping you from giving up on yourself.

Lack of skills/knowledge: Repeat after me: You don’t need to know it all. Seriously… You don’t. It’s better that you don’t because you can learn and adjust as you go. This is what I like to call just-in-time learning.
