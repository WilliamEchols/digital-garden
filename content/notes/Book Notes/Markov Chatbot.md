# Quote

>It was the engineer and mathematician Claude Shannon who first realized that the Markov chain could be used not only to analyze text, but to generate it. Suppose you want to produce a passage of text with the same statistical properties as written English, and it starts with ON. Then you can use a random number generator to select the next letter; there should be a 14.7% chance it is S, an 11.3% chance it is T, and so on. Having chosen your next letter (T, say), you have your next bigram (NT) and you can proceed as before, as long as you like
