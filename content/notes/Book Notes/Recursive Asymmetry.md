Afterwards he said that figuring this out had taken him “three years of Sundays.” The moral of this tale is that although it took Cole a great deal of work and perseverance to find these factors, it did not take him long to justify his result to a room full of mathematicians (and, indeed, to give a proof that he was correct). Thus we see that one can provide a short proof, even if finding that proof takes a long time

# Note

Proof asymmetry just like the primes it describes (recursive asymmetry)
