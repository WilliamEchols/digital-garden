# Quote

>Here, for instance, is Lincoln, writing in his own private notes in 1854, in a very geometrical style: <br><br>If A. can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right, enslave B.â€”why may not B. snatch the same argument, and prove equally, that he may enslave A.? <br><br>Moral permissibility, Lincoln suggests, should be invariant, like the area of a Euclidean triangle
