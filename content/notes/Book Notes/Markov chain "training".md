# Quote

>Of course, the Markov chain depends on the body of text you use to learn the probabilities: the “training data,” as we say in the machine learning business. Norvig used the massive body of text Google harvested from websites and your emails; Shannon used the books on his shelf; Markov used Pushkin. Here’s some text I generated using a Markov chain trained on a list of names given to babies born in the United States in 1971

Can I train a [[notes/Markov Chain|Markov Chain]] based on my own writing? Or see my vowel-consonant signature as it changes over time?
