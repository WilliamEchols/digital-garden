# Quote

>Reflecting on a game he’d played against Veselin Topalov twenty years earlier, Kasparov says, “I was amazed by the beauty of this geometry.” The tree geometry tells you how to win; it doesn’t tell you what makes a game beautiful. That’s a subtler geometry, and for now it’s not one a machine can compute step by step with a short list of rules.
