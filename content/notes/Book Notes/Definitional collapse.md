Chapter 3: Giving the Same Name to Different Things

# Quote

>This brings us to another slogan of the always-quotable Poincaré: “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.” Definitional collapses like this are part of our everyday thinking and speaking. Imagine if, when someone asked you if you were from Chicago, you said, “No, I’m from the Chicago of twenty-five years ago”
