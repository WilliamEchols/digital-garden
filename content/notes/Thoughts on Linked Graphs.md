I greatly appreciate the benefit of interconnected graphs when I myself am deep into a note. [[notes/Graph|Graph]]s allow for the Google Street view of note taking as you walk around the paths that connect them, but from afar, it can be daunting to get oriented. 

I often find myself in a practical struggle of deciding when to organize my notes into sub-folders (a handy tool from a top-down perspective), but that is naturally antagonistic to a "pure" linked approach. For instance, due books notes belong in Books/? Surely that would clog up Books/ and make it unusable to actually find titles. I can put a subfolder within Books/ such as Books/Notes/. This works well for book notes but then I have to remember that this is where these notes belong. The benefit of categories only applies when the person using the categories is careful to categorize everything- its an all or nothing approach. It would be interesting to simply have no folders and allow structures between notes to function naturally. Perhaps in a perfect world this would occur, but in reality I would be afraid of messy data- the same connecting nodes that reveal patterns by definition blur lines which is difficult for rigid applications such as work or school. 

As a connecting point, true Zettelkasten removes titles as it inherently categorizes the thought. The idea of titling a selection of text improves access but seemingly at a cost of order.
