# A Book of Abstract Algebra
## Charles Pinter

### Requirements for Operation on set A
1. a * b is defined for every ordered pair (a, b)
2. a * b is uniquely defined
3. a * b is in A if a and b are in A

![[Pinter Algebra.pdf#page=27]]
A. 
1. * is an operation on the set $\mathbb{Q}$
2. * is an operation on the set { $x \in \mathbb{R}$: x > 0 }
3. * is not an operation on $\mathbb{R}$ as it is not uniquely defined
4. - is an operation of $\mathbb{Z}$
5. - is not an operation on { $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ : >= 0 }  as not closed when b > a
6. * is an operation of { $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ : >= 0 }
