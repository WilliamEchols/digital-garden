# Introduction

Sets occur everywhere in mathematics and other subjects whose foundations are mathematical. We have been using the word "set" since Chapter 1, but we have never defined what this word means. In many ways, this situation cannot be avoided. Take a moment now to try to define what you mean by a "set" ... Do you find yourself saying something like "a collection of objects"? Can you define *mathematically* what this means? Of course not; "collection" is just as mathematically vague as "set"!

Just as Euclid took concepts such as "point" and "line" in geometry as *basic* or *undefined*, we will (for now) take the concept of "set" to be undefined. We will insist that for any particular set $A$, membership in $A$ (i.e., whether an object is in the set $A$ or not) must be well-defined (i.e., for any fixed object $x$ in the underlying universe under discussion, the answer to the question, "is $x$ in $A$?" must be either always "yes" or always "no", regardless of when the question is asked). As we have done since Chapter 1, we will use the notation $\in$ to denote membership in a set.

There are several ways that one can specify or describe a set. One way is to explicitly list its elements inside a pair of curly braces, such as
$$
A = \{1, 2, 3\}
$$
$$
B = \{1,2,3,\dots,10\}
$$
$$
C = \{2,4,6,\dots\}
$$
Here, $B$ appears to be the set of positive integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, and $C$ appears to be the set of even positive integers. The notation "$\dots$", however, is imprecise. We are inferring from the information given that the underlying *universal* set is the set $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ of positive integers (recall our discussion of universal sets in [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/1.1. Language and Logic|1.1. Language and Logic]].3) and that the patterns we see exhibited in the sets $B$ and $C$ continue.

A more precise way of describing a set is to use "set-builder" notation to specify the precise property that the elements of the set should satisfy. This description is sometimes called a *conditional definition* of the set.

We have already made a very reasonable assumption about sets, namely, that a set is uniquely determined by its elements (the *Axiom of Extensionality* in formal, axiomatic set theory). The unique set with no elements is denoted by $\emptyset$ and is called the *empty set* or *null set*. It is important to note right away that $\emptyset$ is different from $\{\emptyset\}$. (Be sure you can explain why!)

The assumption that a set is uniquely determined by its elements provides the definition of what it means for two sets to be equal ([[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Definition 4.1.6.|Definition 4.1.6.]]); namely, two sets are equal if they have the same elements. Before working more this this idea, we first define what is means for one set to be "contained" in another set.

Take a moment to write the definition of $A \nsubseteq B$ symbolically, by forming a useful denial of (4.4). You'll find this symbolic representation useful when writing proofs.
