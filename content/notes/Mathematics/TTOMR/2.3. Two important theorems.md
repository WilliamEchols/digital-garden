# Introduction
So far we have considered examples of direct and indirect proofs, taking advantage of the logical equivalence of statements, when necessary. The example we have considered have been of fairly straightforward mathematical statements, since our primary goal has been to illustrate different techniques of proof.

In this section, we prove two very important facts, that $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. These proofs are more sophisticated than the others we have considered up to now, but the basic setup of these indirect proofs follows the same patterns as the techniques we have discussed.

For the first result, note that the statement
$$
\boxed{\sqrt{ 2 } \text{ is irrational}}
$$
is a negative one
$$
\tag{2.12}
\neg(\exists p,q\in\mathbb{Z}^{+})[\frac{p}{q}=\sqrt{ 2 }]
$$
(Note that since $\sqrt{ 2 }>0$), we may take the universe for $p$ and $q$ to be $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, rather than $\mathbb{Z}$.) Because the statement we wish to prove is negative, it makes sense to try a proof by contradiction. Assuming the negation of statement (2.12) yields the following Given-Goal diagram:

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ | |
| $\frac{p}{q}=\sqrt{ 2 }$ | Contradiction |
# $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational

The argument that, for example, $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational is similar. See Exercise 3.2.1.

Our next example of an indirect proof, that there are infinitely many prime numbers, is due to Euclid. In order to prove this result, we need three pieces of information: the definition of "prime number", the definition of "infinitely many", and the existence part of the *Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic*, a result with which you may already be familiar about factoring positive integers as products of primes. We review these statements below.
