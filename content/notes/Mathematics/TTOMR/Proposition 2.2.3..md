*For all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, if $n^2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd*
**Proof.** Let $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ be arbitrary. We prove the contrapositive. Assume that $n$ is even; we show that $n^2$ is also even.

Since $n$ is even, by definition we may fix $k\in\mathbb{{Z}}$ such that $n=2k$. Then
$$
n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2=2(2k^2),
$$
and hence $n^2$ is even, also by definition.
Hence, if $n^2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.
