Sometimes one is unable to find a single argument that works in general to prove a statement. Consider the statement
> for all integers $a, a(a+1)$ is even

Again, we'll try to get a sense for the statement by computing $a(a+1)$ for various values of $a$.
$$
a=4: \quad a(a+1) = 4(5) = 2(2)(5) \text{ is even}
$$
$$
a=17: \quad a(a+1) = 17(18) = 2(17)(9) \text{ is even}
$$
$$
a=-5: \quad a(a+1) = -5(-4) = 2(-5)(-2) \text{ is even}
$$
Notice the intuition of either $a$ or $a+1$ being even, and an integer times an even integer results in an even integer

Hence, since we have considered all possible cases for the integer $a$, we have proved that for all integers $a$, $a(a+1)$ is even.

The most important thing about a proof by cases is that the cases need to consider all possibilities for the object in question (here, for the arbitrary integer $a$, $a$ is either even or not). Note that a proof by cases may have more than two cases.

Thus, we can amend out earlier statement in [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/1.2 Proof|1.2 Proof]] about how to prove that something is a widget.
