In Subsection 1.2.2. and [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/2.1 More Direct Proofs|2.1 More Direct Proofs]], we have been concentrating on *direct proofs* of statements such as $p\implies Q$, $(\forall x)P(x)$, and $(\exists x)P(x)$. Sometimes, however, it can be difficult to determine how to proceed using these methods. For example, suppose we want to prove that
$$
\boxed{\text{there do not exist integers }m,n\in\mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } 12m+9n=100}
$$
Our initial Given-Goal diagram is the following:

| Given | Goal |
|---|---|
| Nothing | $\neg(\exists m,n\in\mathbb{Z})[12m+9n=100]$

How can we proceed? We're given nothing, and we are trying to show that something does not exist. Even rewriting
$$
\neg(\exists m,n\in\mathbb{Z})[12m+9n=100]
$$
as
$$
(\forall m,n\in\mathbb{Z})[12m+9n\ne_{1}00]
$$
does not seem to help:

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $m,n \in\mathbb{Z}$ arbitrary | $12m+9n\ne 100$ |

It seems difficult to show that arbitrary integers $m$ and $n$, about which we know nothing, have the desired property.

One thing to try in such a statement is to assume that $\neg P$ is true, and then try to deduce a statement $R$ such as
$$
\tag{2.10} 0 = 1
$$
or
$$
\tag{2.11} Q \land \neg Q, \text{ where $Q$ is some statement}
$$

A statement such as (2.10) or (2.11) is called a *contradiction*. More precisely, a statement $R$ involving statement variables, such as $Q \land \neg Q$, is a *contradiction* if every assignment of truth values to the statement variables in $R$ makes $R$  false; see Exercise 1.1.4.

If we can find such a contradiction $R$, then we will have a valid proof that the implication $(\neg P)\implies R$ is true and $R$ is false. Hence, we will have proved that $P$ is true, which is what we wanted all along. This proof technique is called *proof by contradiction*, and it is an example of an *indirect* method of proof

<center><b>Table 2.1.</b> Proof by contradiction</center>

| To prove a statement $P$ is true by contradiction |
| --- | 
| We begin with "Assume $\neg P$ is true."|
| We deduce a contradiction. |
| We then conclude that $P$ is true |

Let's use this technique to prove that there are no integers $m$ and $n$ such that $12m+9n=100$; i.e., $\neg(\exists m,n\in\mathbb{Z})[12m+9n=100]$. Since this will be a proof by contradiction, we will assume
$$
\neg\neg(\exists m,n\in\mathbb{Z})[12m+9n=100]
$$
By Exercise 1.1.2a, this is logically equivalent to
$$
(\exists m,n\in\mathbb{Z})[12m+9n=100]
$$
We search for a contradiction. Our Given-Goal diagram now takes the following form:

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$ | |
| $12m+9n=100$ | Contradiction |

The tricky part to a proof by contradiction is that, while we know that we are looking for a contradiction, we usually do not know ahead of time what form that contradiction will take. So we just following where our Given column takes us logically and stay on the lookout for a contradiction. 

We know $12m+9n=100$; a logical thing to do is to factor the left-hand side to obtain
$$
3(4m+2n)=100
$$
Recalling [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Definition 2.1.1|Definition 2.1.1]], we see that this says that 100 is divisible by 3. But $3\nmid 100$ by the order properties of the integers, since $3\cdot 33=99$ and $3 \cdot 34=102$. We've found a contradiction; namely, we've proved that $3 \mid 100$  and $3 \nmid 100$, i.e., a statement of the form $Q \land \neg Q$.

![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Proposition 2.2.1|Proposition 2.2.1]]

Note that our proof by cases, above, i.e., that every multiple of 3 is either less than or equal to 99 or greater than or equal to 102, is exactly the type of proof needed in [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Example 2.1.2|Example 2.1.2]] to show that $5\nmid 12$.

The next statement we'll consider deals with rational and irrational numbers. Recall that a real number $z$ is *rational* if there exist integers $a,b$ with $b\ne 0$ such that $z=\frac{a}{b}$. A real number is *irrational* if it is not rational; thus, to prove (directly) that a real number $z$ is irrational, one must show that integers with a particular property do *not* exist. We'll now prove that
$$
\boxed{\text{the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational}}
$$
We begin with our initial Given-Goal diagram.

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ arbitrary | |
| $x\in\mathbb{Q}$ | |
| $y$ is irrational | $x+y$ is irrational |

Since trying (directly) to show that $x+y$ is irrational amounts to showing that something *does not exist*, it again seems reasonable to try an indirect proof by contradiction. We rewrite our Given-Goal diagram for this approach.

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ arbitrary | |
| $x$ is irrational | |
| $y$ is irrational | |
| $x+y$ is rational | Contradiction |

Since we know that the sum and product of two rational numbers is rational (see page 28 - [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Theorem 2.1.5.|Theorem 2.1.5.]] and Proposition 2.1.6.), we should try to exploit these facts using $x$ and $x+y$ in some way. Since we are looking for a contradiction, it makes sense to work with $y$, which is easy to express in terms of $x$ and $x+y$:
$$
y=(x+y)-x
$$
We have the idea of the proof; now we need to express the details carefully.
