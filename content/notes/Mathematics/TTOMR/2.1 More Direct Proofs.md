# Introduction

The logical structure of a mathematical statement, in particular, the logical structure of the *Goal* will dictate the form of its proof. The logical structure of a mathematical definition gives us a clear strategy for trying to establish that an object has (or doesn't have) that particular property.

For out first proof about real numbers, we'll prove that 
> for all $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b < 0$, $a^{2} > b^{2}$

Our Given-Goal diagram contains the usual information.

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ | |
| $a < 0$ | |
| $b < 0$ | |
| $a < b$ | $a^{2} > b^{2}$ |
