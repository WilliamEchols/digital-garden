*For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, if $x$ is rational and $y$ is irrational, then $x+y$ is irrational.*
**Proof.** Let $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary, and assume that $x$ is rational and $y$ is irrational. For the sake of a contradiction, also assume that $x+y$ is rational. Note that $(-1)x$ is rational, since the product of rational numbers is another rational number. Also, $(x+y)+(-1)x$ is rational, since the sum of rational numbers is another rational number. Since $y=(x+y)+(-1x)$, this implies that $y$ is rational, a contradiction, since we are given that $y$ is irrational. Thus $x+y$ is irrational, as desired.
