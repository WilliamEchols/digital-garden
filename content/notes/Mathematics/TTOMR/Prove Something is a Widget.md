## Original definition (1.2)

> If we wish to prove that something is a *widget* and all we know about widgets is the definition, then we must use the definition to prove it's a widget.
> The logical form of the definition of widget determines the structure of a proof that something is a widget. 

## Refined definition (2.1)

> If we wish to prove that something is a *widget*, then we must either use the definition of widget or we must use a previously proved result that implies that something is a widget.
> If we use the definition, then its logical form determines the structure of a proof that something is a widget.
> If we use a previously proved result that implies that something is a widget, then we must verify the hypothesis of that result.
