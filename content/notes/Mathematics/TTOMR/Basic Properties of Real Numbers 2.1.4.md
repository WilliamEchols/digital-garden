For real integers a, b, c

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Closure under + and $\cdot$** | $a + b$ and $ab$ are also integers |
| **Associative properties** | $(a + b) + c = a + (b+c)$ and $(ab)c = a(bc)$ |
| **Commutative properties** | $a + b = b + a$ and $ab = ba$ |
| **Distributive properties** | $a(b+c)=ab+ac$ |
| **Identities** | $0 \ne 1$, $a+0=a$, $a \cdot 1 = a$, and $a \cdot 0 = 0$ |
| **Additive inverses** | There is a unique integer $-a=-1 \cdot a$ such that $a + (-a) =0$ |
| **Subtraction** | $b-a$ is defined equal to $b + (-a)$ |
| **Multiplicative inverses** | If $a \ne 0$, then there is a unique real number $a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 1$ |
| **Division** | When $a \ne 0$, $\frac{b}{a}$ is defined equal to $b \cdot \frac{1}{a}$
| **Transitive property of <** | If $a < b$ and $b < c$, then $a < c$ |
| **Trichotomy** | Exactly one of $a < b$ or $a = b$ or $a > b$ holds |
| **Order property 1** | If $a < b$ , then $a + c < b + c$ |
| **Order property 2** | If $c > 0$ , then $a < b$ iff $ac < bc$ |
| **Order property 3** | If $c < 0$ , then $a < b$ iff $ac > bc$ |

There is one additional axiom for $\mathbb{R}$, called the *Completeness Axiom*. Except for the following theorem about the existence of $n$th roots, which we will accept and use for proof, the Completeness Axiom will not be needed or discussed until Chapter 9.
