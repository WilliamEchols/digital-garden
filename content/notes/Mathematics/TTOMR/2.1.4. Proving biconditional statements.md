So far we have not proved any bicondition, or "iff" statements. Let's try to prove the familiar statement that for all real numbers $a,b$ with $b \ge 0$,
$$
\boxed{|a| \leq b \text{ iff } -b \leq a \leq b}
$$
First, we must remember that there are two statements to proved, the forward ($\implies$) direction
$$
\text{if } |a| \leq b, \text{ then } -b\leq a\leq b,
$$
and the backwards ($\impliedby$) direction
$$
\text{if }-b\leq a\leq b, \text{ then }|a|\leq b.
$$
Also recall that the compound inequality $-b\leq a\leq b$ is an abbreviation for the statement "$-b\leq a$ and $a\leq b$". Finally, we need to recall the definition of the absolute value function.

As we begin our scratch work, we note that it is likely (although not automatic) that this proof will involve cases, since the definition of $|x|$ is a definition by cases involving $x$. We provide the Given-Goal diagrams but leave any additional scratch work up to you.

For($\implies$):

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ | $-b\leq a\leq b$ |
| $b \geq 0$ | (i.e., |
| \|$a$\| $\leq b$ | $-b\leq a$ and $a\leq b$) |

For ($\impliedby$):

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ | |
| $b \geq 0$ | |
| $-b \leq a\leq b$ | |
| (i.e., | |
| $-b \leq a$ and $a\leq b$) | \l$a$\| $\leq b$ |
