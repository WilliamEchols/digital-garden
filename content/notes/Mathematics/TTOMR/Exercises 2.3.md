1. Prove that $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational. (HINT: You will need the result of [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Exercises 2.2|Exercises 2.2]] \#6a)
2. Prove that for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, at least one of $\sqrt{ 3 }-x$ and $\sqrt{ 3 }+x$ is irrational.
3. Prove that $\log_{2}{3}$ is irrational. (NOTE: Recall that $\log_{2}{3}$ is the real number $y$ such that $2^y=3$. You may assume, without proof, the familiar "rules of exponents".) 
4. In [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Theorem 2.3.1.|Theorem 2.3.1.]], what is the purpose of assuming that $p$ and $q$ do not have any common positive integer factors other than 1? How does the proof change if we do not make this assumption?
