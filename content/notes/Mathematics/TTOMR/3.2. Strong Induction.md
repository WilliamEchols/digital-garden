# Introduction
Recall that, informally, a sequence is a list of real numbers. More precisely, a sequence is given by a function defined on the positive integers. For example, the function $a(n)=\frac{1}{n}$, for $n\geq 1$, defines the sequence
$$
1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \dots
$$
In general we write $a_{n}$, rather than $a(n)$, and a sequence
$$
a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots
$$
is denoted by $\{a_{n}\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ 

Consider the following recursively defined sequence $\{a_{n}\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ 
$$
a_{1}=1,
$$
$$
a_{2}=5,
$$
$$
\text{for all } n\geq 2, a_{n+1} = a_{n} + 2a_{n+1}
$$

Let's try to guess a formula for $a_{n}$. Computing the first few integers in the sequence shows that
$$
a_{3}=a_{2}+2a_{1}=5+2(1)=7
$$
$$
a_{4}=a_{3}+2a_{2}=7+2(5)=17
$$
$$
a_{5}=a_{4}+2a_{3} = 17 + 2(7) = 31
$$
$$
a_{6} = a_{5} + 2a_{4} = 31 + 2(17) = 65
$$
Note that these numbers are almost, but not quite, powers of 2:
$$
a_{1}=1=2^1-1
$$
$$
a_{2}=5=2^2+1
$$
$$
a_{3}=7=2^3-1
$$
$$
a_{4}=17=2^3+1
$$
$$
a_{5}=31=2^5-1
$$
$$
a_{6}=65=2^6+1
$$
Thus, a reasonable guess is that
$$
a_{n}=2^n+(-1)^n \quad \text{ for } n\geq 1
$$
This formula is called a *closed formula* for the recursively defined sequence; i.e., it describes $a_{n}$ as a function of $n$.

How can we prove that our closed formula is correct? It seems clear that induction is needed; the recursive definition has abase case (in fact, two of them) and an inductive step. However, the inductive step seems problematic. If we set up the inductive step according to PMI, then we have the following Given-Goal diagram.

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+} \ (m\geq 2)$ | |
| $a_{m+1}=a_{m}+2a_{m-1}$ | |
| $a_{m} = 2^m + (-1)^m$ (IH) | $a_{m+1} = 2^{m+1} + (-1)^{m+1}$ |

However, the inductive step in the recursive definition defines $a_{m+1}$ in terms of *two* predecessors ($a_{m}$ and $a_{m-1}$) , rather than the usual one predecessor $a_{m}$. Our usual inductive hypothesis will give us information about $a_{m}$, but no information about $a_{m+1}$. Thus, we appear to need a new form of induction.

# Note
We end this section by commenting that one might wonder whether the Principle of *Strong* Mathematical Induction is in fact a "stronger" statement than the Principle of Mathematical Induction. In fact these statements are logically equivalent. In other words, if we accept PSMI as an axiom, then we can prove PMI (this should be easy to prove), and conversely, if we accept PMI as an axiom, then we can prove PSMI. (See Exercise 3.2.5.)
