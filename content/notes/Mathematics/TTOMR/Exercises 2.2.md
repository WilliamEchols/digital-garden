1. Prove [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Proposition 2.2.4.|Proposition 2.2.4.]], for that all integers $n$, if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even, using *definitions*.
2. Prove that there are no integers $n$ such that $n$ is both even and odd.
3. Prove there are no integers $m$ and $n$ such that $8m+26n=1$.
4. Prove there are no integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m^2=4n+2$. (HINT: Use [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Proposition 2.2.4.|Proposition 2.2.4.]])
5. Prove there are no integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m^2=4n+3$.
6. In this problem, you may use the fact (which we prove in Chapter 6) that an integer $n$ is not divisible by 3 if and only if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n=3k+1$ or $n=3k+2$
	1. a) Prove that for all integers $n$, if $3\mid n^2$, then $3\mid n$
	2. b) Prove that for all integers $i$ and $j$, if $3\mid(i^2+j^2)$, then $3\mid i$ and $3|j$
7. Prove that for all $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, if $a\mid b$, then $a\leq b$.
8. Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Prove that if $a\mid b$ and $b\mid a$, then $a=b$.
9. Determine whether each statement is true or false. If true, then prove it. If false, then provide a counterexample.
	1. a) The sum of two irrational numbers is irrational.
	2. b) The product of two irrational numbers is irrational
	3. c) The product of nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
10. Using *definitions* and the method of [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Proposition 2.2.3.|Proposition 2.2.3.]], prove that for all integers $m$ and $n$, if $mn$ is even, then $m$ is even or $n$ is even.
11. Prove that for all real numbers $x,x^3+3x-4>0$ if and only if $x<-4$ or $x>1$.
12. Prove that for all numbers $x$ and $y$, if $x^3=y^3$, then $x=y$. (Your proof should not mention anything called a "cube root". Use [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Exercises 2.1|Exercises 2.1]] \#8)
13. Let $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and assume that for all $\epsilon>0,|x|<\epsilon$. Prove that $x=0$. (HINT: Use a proof by contradiction, and find a specific $\epsilon>0$ contradicting the hypothesis.)
