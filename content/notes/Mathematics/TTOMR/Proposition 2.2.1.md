*There do not exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $12m+9n=100$.*
**Proof.** Assume for the sake of a contradiction that we have integers $m$ and $n$ such that $12m+9n=100$. Then $3(4m+3n)=100$;i.e., $3 \mid 100$ by definition. But 100 us not divisible by 3 because every integer $k$ either satisfies $k\leq 33$ or $k\geq 34$, and hence every multiple $3k$ of $3$ satisfies $3k\leq 99$ or $3k\geq 102$, by the order properties of the integers. Thus, we have a contradiction. Hence, there do not exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $12m+9n=100$.
