*For all $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b < 0$, $a^{2} > b^{2}$*
**Proof.** Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b < 0$. We prove that $a^{2} > b^{2}$.

Multiplying both sides of the inequality $a < b$ by $a$ gives $a^{2} > ab$ by an order axiom (see [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Basic Properties of Real Numbers 2.1.4|Basic Properties of Real Numbers 2.1.4]]), since $a < 0$. Similarly, multiplying both sides of the inequality $a < b$ by $b$ gives $ab > b^{2}$, since $b < 0$. Since $a^{2} > ab$ and $ab > b^{2}$, we have $a^{2} > b^{2}$ by the transitive properties of the order relation as desired.
