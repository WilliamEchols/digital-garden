# Introduction
The statement of Euclid's theorem, that there exist infinitely many prime numbers, is another example of "hidden quantifiers". As we have stated it, the theorem may sound existential to you, i.e., like it has the form $(\exists m)P(n)$. However, the logical form of the statement is actually more complicated; it is a two-quantifier statement, where the type of quantifier *alternates* (here, from $\forall$ to $\exists$)
$$
(\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+})(\exists m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+})[m\geq n \text{ and } m \text{ is prime}]
$$
We also say that this statement has *mixed* quantifiers.

Another example of a statement hiding a second quantifier is "There is a smallest positive integer." If we unravel this statement, it says "there is a positive integer $x$ such that $x$ is less than or equal to any positive integer"; i.e.,
$$
\tag{2.14}
(\exists x\in\mathbb{Z}^{+})(\forall y \in \mathbb{Z}^{+})[x\leq y]
$$
Equation (2.14) is a true statement. To prove it, we begin by noting that the outermost quantifier is $\exists$; this tells us that we must give a particular example of a positive integer $x$ which satisfies
$$
(\forall y\in\mathbb{Z}^{+})[x\leq y]
$$
This is easy: note that $1\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ satisfies $(\forall y\in\mathbb{Z}^{+})[1\leq y]$

Note also that, as in our previous discussion of quantifiers, the universe matters. If we change (2.14) to
$$
(\exists x\in\mathbb{Z})(\forall y\in\mathbb{Z})[x\leq y]
$$
then this statement is false. To prove this, we must prove that
$$
\neg(\exists x\in\mathbb{Z})(\forall y\in\mathbb{Z})[x\leq y]
$$
is true, i.e., that
$$
(\forall x\in\mathbb{Z})(\exists y\in\mathbb{Z})[x>y]
$$
is true.

Again, the way we begin the proof is dictated by the outermost quantifier.

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ arbitrary | $(\exists y\in\mathbb{Z})[x>y]$ |

So, given $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ arbitrary, we must demonstrate a particular integer $y$ which is strictly less than $x$. Note that $y=x-1$ is an integer and $x\geq y$ since $x>x-1$. We have proved that $(\forall x\in\mathbb{Z})(\exists y\in\mathbb{Z})[x>y]$ is true, and hence the statement $(\exists m\in\mathbb{Z})(\forall y\in\mathbb{Z})[x\leq y]$ is false.

Regardless of the number of quantifiers in a quantified statement
$$
(Q_{1}x_{1})(Q_{2}x_{2})\dots(Qkxk)[\dots],
$$
where $Q_{1},Q_{2},\dots,Qk$ are quantifiers, we always begin with the outermost quantifier and "work our way in". When we see a string of identical quantifiers, such as in the statements
$$
(\forall x)(\forall y)P(x,y) \text{ or } (\exists x)(\exists y)(\exists z)Q(x,y,z)
$$
then the order of these quantifiers doesn't matter. For example
$$
(\forall x)(\forall y)P(x,y) \text{ and } (\forall y)(\forall x)P(x,y)
$$
have the same logical meaning, and both can be thought of as $(\forall x,y)P(x,y)$. Similarly (considering one possible reordering),
$$
(\exists x)(\exists y)(\exists z)Q(x,y,z) \text{ and } (\exists z)(\exists x)(\exists y)Q(x,y,z)
$$
have the same logical meaning, and both can be thought of as $(\exists x,y,z)Q(x,y,z)$. However, we must be careful with mixed quantifiers: in general
$$
\boxed{\text{order of mixed quantifiers matters}}
$$
We can easily see that his must be the case by comparing the following two "common sense" statements. Let $S$ be the set of all students at your college or university.
The statement
$$
(\forall x\in\mathbb{S})(\exists y\in\mathbb{S})[x \text{ and } y \text{ are friends}]
$$
says that every student at your college or university is friends with some students at your college or university. This is not the same statement as
$$
(\exists y\in\mathbb{S})(\forall x\in\mathbb{S})[x \text{ and } y \text{ are friends}],
$$
which says that some student at your college or university is friends with every student at your college or university!

In addition, moving quantifiers within a statement can change the truth value of that statement. For example, consider  the statement
$$
\tag{2.15}
(\forall x)[(\forall y)(y>0)\implies x>0]
$$
where the quantifiers range over $\mathbb{R}$. Statement (2.15) is true, since given an arbitrary $x\in\mathbb{R}$, the statement $(\forall y)(y>0)$ is false in $\mathbb{R}$, so $(\forall y)(y>0)\implies x>0$ is true in $\mathbb{R}$.
However, the statement
$$
(\forall x)(\forall y)[y>0\implies x>0]
$$
is false in $\mathbb{R}$; i.e.,
$$
(\exists x)(\exists y)[y>0 \land x\leq 0]
$$
is true in $\mathbb{R}$, since $x=-1$ and $y=3$ satisfy $y>0 \land x\leq 0$

When there do exist rules for moving quantifiers around (see \[10], we will not be employing them.
$$
\boxed{\text{Don't move quantifiers around within mathematical statements}}
$$
