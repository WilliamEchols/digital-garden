In this example, given a positive real number $x$, we wish to determine whether one of the expressions $\frac{x}{x+1}$ and $\frac{x+1}{x+2}$ is always larger than the other. We can try some simple examples, with $x$ a positive integer, to see what we think.

| x | $\frac{x}{x+1}$ | $\frac{x+1}{x+2}$ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{2}{3}$ |
| 2 | $\frac{2}{3}$ | $\frac{3}{4}$ |
| 3 | $\frac{3}{4}$ | $\frac{4}{5}$ |
| 4 | $\frac{4}{5}$ | $\frac{5}{6}$ |

It appears that, at least for positive $integers \ x$,
$$\frac{x}{x+1} < \frac{x+1}{x+2}$$

We'll try to prove this for all positive $real \ numbers \ x$.

| Given | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| $x \in \mathbb{R}$ | |
| $x > 0$ | $\frac{x}{x+1} < \frac{x+1}{x+2}$ |

**Warning:** Working backwards is *strategy for finding* a proof, not a proof in itself. The reason for this is that when we work backwards, we will *assume* what we are trying to prove, *which is never allowed*. When we work backwards, we are hoping to eventually find a statement that we "already" know is true, such as an instance of an axiom or a statement that we have already proved. We do not know ahead of time what that statement will be. More importantly, we are also hoping that our reasoning is *reversible*, which we must also check. We've already seen that the converse of a true implication need not also be true, so that working backwards *may not work*. Thus, when working backwards, we must verify that we can construct a valid proof.
