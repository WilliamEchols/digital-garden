1. Let $a_{1}=2,a_{2}=4,$ and $a_{n+1}=7a_{n}-10a_{n-1}$ for all $n\geq 2$. Conjecture a closed formula for $a_{n}$ and then prove your result.
2. Let $a_{1}=3,a_{2}=4,$ and $a_{n+1}=\frac{1}{3}(2a_{n}+a_{n-1})$ for all $n\geq 2$. Prove that for all positive integers $n,3\leq a_{n}\leq 4$
3. Without using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, use strong induction to prove that for all positive integers $n$ with $n\geq 2$, $n$ has a prime factor
4. For $i\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, let $p_{i}$ denote the $i$th prime number, so that
	1. $$p_{1}=2\quad \quad p_{2}=3\quad\quad p_{3}=5,\dots$$
	2. Prove that for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+},p_{n}\leq 2^{2^{n-1}}.$ (HINT: For the induction step, given $m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$), show that $p_{m+1}\leq p_{1}p_{2}\dots p_{m}+1$
5. In this exercise, you will prove that PMI is logically equivalent to PSMI; in other words, given PMI, show that you can deduce PSMI, and vice versa
