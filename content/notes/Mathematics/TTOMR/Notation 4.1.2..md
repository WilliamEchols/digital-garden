Let $P(x)$ be a statement with a single free variable $x$. Then the notation
$$
\{x \mid P(x)\} \quad \text{ or } \quad \{x:P(x)\}
$$
denotes the set of all objects $x$ in the underlying universal set such that $P(x)$ is true.

When $X$ is a set, the notation $\{x\in\mathbb{X}\mid P(x)\}$ is an abbreviation for the set $\{x \mid x \in X \text{ and } P(x)\}$.
