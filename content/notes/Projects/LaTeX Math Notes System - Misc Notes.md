1. **Obsidian-Like Linking**: To achieve this, you could use a simple anchor (`<a>`) tag to represent a link to another document. When clicked, this should fetch and render the linked document. This can be achieved with React Router for client-side routing and `navigate()` for programmatically changing the route.
