1. [[notes/Goldbach's Conjecture|Goldbach's Conjecture]]: Can every even integer greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes?
2. Twin prime conjecture: Are there infinitely many primes _p_ such that _p_ + 2 is prime?
3. Legendre's conjecture: Does there always exist at least one prime between consecutive perfect squares?
4. Are there infinitely many primes _p_ such that _p_ − 1 is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form _n_2 + 1?
