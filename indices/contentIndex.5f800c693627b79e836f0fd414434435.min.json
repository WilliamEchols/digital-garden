Recall that a real number $z$ is *rational* if there exist integers $a,b$ with $b\\ne 0$ such that $z=\\frac{a}{b}$. A real number is *irrational* if it is not rational; thus, to prove (directly) that a real number $z$ is irrational, one must show that integers with a particular property do *not* exist.

We an also think of this as a proof by cases, where one of the cases is automatic. for example, if $P$ is true, then $P \\lor Q$ is automatically true; thus, we need only consider the case when $P$ is false; i.e., when $\\neg P$ is true. The analogous approach with the roles of $P$ and $Q$ interchanged is also permitted.\n\nNote that in this case either of the statements $a\\geq \\sqrt{ b }$ or $q\\leq-\\sqrt{ b }$ can be $P$. In general, however, your choice of $P$ and $Q$ will depend on the statements themselves and whatever is easier to work with.

The example we have considered have been of fairly straightforward mathematical statements, since our primary goal has been to illustrate different techniques of proof.\n\nIn this section, we prove two very important facts, that $\\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. These proofs are more sophisticated than the others we have considered up to now, but the basic setup of these indirect proofs follows the same patterns as the techniques we have discussed.\n\nFor the first result, note that the statement\n$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{ 2 } \\text{ is irrational}}\n$$\nis a negative one\n$$\n\\tag{2.12}\n\\neg(\\exists p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})[\\frac{p}{q}=\\sqrt{ 2 }]\n$$\n(Note that since $\\sqrt{ 2 }\u003e0$), we may take the universe for $p$ and $q$ to be $\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, rather than $\\mathbb{Z}$.) Because the statement we wish to prove is negative, it makes sense to try a proof by contradiction. Assuming the negation of statement (2.12) yields the following Given-Goal diagram:\n\n| Given | Goal |\n| --- | --- |\n| $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ | |\n| $\\frac{p}{q}=\\sqrt{ 2 }$ | Contradiction |\n# $\\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Theorem 2.3.1.|Theorem 2.3.1.]]\n\nThe argument that, for example, $\\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational is similar. See Exercise 3.2.1.\n\nOur next example of an indirect proof, that there are infinitely many prime numbers, is due to Euclid. In order to prove this result, we need three pieces of information: the definition of \"prime number\", the definition of \"infinitely many\", and the existence part of the *Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic*, a result with which you may already be familiar about factoring positive integers as products of primes. We review these statements below.\n# Prime Definition\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Definition 2.3.2.|Definition 2.3.2.]]\n# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Theorem 2.3.3 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)|Theorem 2.3.3 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)]]\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Theorem 2.3.4|Theorem 2.3.4]]\n# Exercises\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Exercises 2.3|Exercises 2.3]]\n# Next\n[[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/2.4.

Proofs of statements involving mixed quantifiers","content":"\n# Previous\n[[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/2.3. Two important theorems|2.3. Two important theorems]]\n# Introduction\nThe statement of Euclid's theorem, that there exist infinitely many prime numbers, is another example of \"hidden quantifiers\". As we have stated it, the theorem may sound existential to you, i.e., like it has the form $(\\exists m)P(n)$. However, the logical form of the statement is actually more complicated; it is a two-quantifier statement, where the type of quantifier *alternates* (here, from $\\forall$ to $\\exists$)\n$$\n(\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})(\\exists m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})[m\\geq n \\text{ and } m \\text{ is prime}]\n$$\nWe also say that this statement has *mixed* quantifiers.\n\nAnother example of a statement hiding a second quantifier is \"There is a smallest positive integer.\" If we unravel this statement, it says \"there is a positive integer $x$ such that $x$ is less than or equal to any positive integer\"; i.e.,\n$$\n\\tag{2.14}\n(\\exists x\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})(\\forall y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+})[x\\leq y]\n$$\nEquation (2.14) is a true statement. To prove it, we begin by noting that the outermost quantifier is $\\exists$; this tells us that we must give a particular example of a positive integer $x$ which satisfies\n$$\n(\\forall y\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})[x\\leq y]\n$$\nThis is easy: note that $1\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ satisfies $(\\forall y\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})[1\\leq y]$\n\nNote also that, as in our previous discussion of quantifiers, the universe matters. If we change (2.14) to\n$$\n(\\exists x\\in\\mathbb{Z})(\\forall y\\in\\mathbb{Z})[x\\leq y]\n$$\nthen this statement is false. To prove this, we must prove that\n$$\n\\neg(\\exists x\\in\\mathbb{Z})(\\forall y\\in\\mathbb{Z})[x\\leq y]\n$$\nis true, i.e., that\n$$\n(\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{Z})(\\exists y\\in\\mathbb{Z})[x\u003ey]\n$$\nis true.\n\nAgain, the way we begin the proof is dictated by the outermost quantifier.\n\n| Given | Goal |\n| --- | --- |\n| $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ arbitrary | $(\\exists y\\in\\mathbb{Z})[x\u003ey]$ |\n\nSo, given $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ arbitrary, we must demonstrate a particular integer $y$ which is strictly less than $x$. Note that $y=x-1$ is an integer and $x\\geq y$ since $x\u003ex-1$. We have proved that $(\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{Z})(\\exists y\\in\\mathbb{Z})[x\u003ey]$ is true, and hence the statement $(\\exists m\\in\\mathbb{Z})(\\forall y\\in\\mathbb{Z})[x\\leq y]$ is false.\n\nRegardless of the number of quantifiers in a quantified statement\n$$\n(Q_{1}x_{1})(Q_{2}x_{2})\\dots(Qkxk)[\\dots],\n$$\nwhere $Q_{1},Q_{2},\\dots,Qk$ are quantifiers, we always begin with the outermost quantifier and \"work our way in\". When we see a string of identical quantifiers, such as in the statements\n$$\n(\\forall x)(\\forall y)P(x,y) \\text{ or } (\\exists x)(\\exists y)(\\exists z)Q(x,y,z)\n$$\nthen the order of these quantifiers doesn't matter. For example\n$$\n(\\forall x)(\\forall y)P(x,y) \\text{ and } (\\forall y)(\\forall x)P(x,y)\n$$\nhave the same logical meaning, and both can be thought of as $(\\forall x,y)P(x,y)$. Similarly (considering one possible reordering),\n$$\n(\\exists x)(\\exists y)(\\exists z)Q(x,y,z) \\text{ and } (\\exists z)(\\exists x)(\\exists y)Q(x,y,z)\n$$\nhave the same logical meaning, and both can be thought of as $(\\exists x,y,z)Q(x,y,z)$. However, we must be careful with mixed quantifiers: in general\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{order of mixed quantifiers matters}}\n$$\nWe can easily see that his must be the case by comparing the following two \"common sense\" statements. Let $S$ be the set of all students at your college or university.\nThe statement\n$$\n(\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{S})(\\exists y\\in\\mathbb{S})[x \\text{ and } y \\text{ are friends}]\n$$\nsays that every student at your college or university is friends with some students at your college or university. This is not the same statement as\n$$\n(\\exists y\\in\\mathbb{S})(\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{S})[x \\text{ and } y \\text{ are friends}],\n$$\nwhich says that some student at your college or university is friends with every student at your college or university!\n\nIn addition, moving quantifiers within a statement can change the truth value of that statement. For example, consider  the statement\n$$\n\\tag{2.15}\n(\\forall x)[(\\forall y)(y\u003e0)\\implies x\u003e0]\n$$\nwhere the quantifiers range over $\\mathbb{R}$. Statement (2.15) is true, since given an arbitrary $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, the statement $(\\forall y)(y\u003e0)$ is false in $\\mathbb{R}$, so $(\\forall y)(y\u003e0)\\implies x\u003e0$ is true in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nHowever, the statement\n$$\n(\\forall x)(\\forall y)[y\u003e0\\implies x\u003e0]\n$$\nis false in $\\mathbb{R}$; i.e.,\n$$\n(\\exists x)(\\exists y)[y\u003e0 \\land x\\leq 0]\n$$\nis true in $\\mathbb{R}$, since $x=-1$ and $y=3$ satisfy $y\u003e0 \\land x\\leq 0$\n\nWhen there do exist rules for moving quantifiers around (see \\[10], we will not be employing them.\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{Don't move quantifiers around within mathematical statements}}\n$$\n# Quantifiers\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Example 2.4.1.|Example 2.4.1.]]\n# Limit Definition\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Definition 2.4.2.|Definition 2.4.2.]]\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Example 2.4.3.|Example 2.4.3.]]\n# Exercises\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Exercises 2.4|Exercises 2.4]]\n# Next\n[[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/3.1 Principle of Mathematical Induction|3.1 Principle of Mathematical Induction]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.364561905Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/3.1-Principle-of-Mathematical-Induction":{"title":"3.1 Principle of Mathematical Induction","content":"\n# Previous\n[[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/2.4.

Up to now, any direct proof of a statement of the form $(\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})P(n)$ has begun with the assumption \"Let $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ be arbitrary.\" We consider now a new proof technique, called *proof by induction*, for proving a statement about *all* positive integers. The statement of the *Principle of Mathematical Induction* is logically complicated, so we have typeset in **bold** the words showing the logical structure of this statement. \n# PMI\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Theorem 3.1.1. (Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI))|Theorem 3.1.1. (Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI))]]\n# Notation\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Notation 3.1.2.|Notation 3.1.2.]]\n# Example\nFor our first example of a proof using PMI, we will prove a summation formula you may have seen before, perhaps when discussing Riemann sums in calculus. We will prove by induction that for all $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$,\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}k=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{i.e., } 1+2+\\dots+n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\nFor example, when $n=4$, note that \n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{4}k=1+2+3+4=10 \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\\frac{4(5)}{2}=10\n$$\nso the statement is true when $n=4$. To prove he statement is true for *all* positive integers $n$, however, we will use PMI. In this first example, we will show our scratch work in great detail.\n\n*Scratch work:* Given $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we'll let $P(n)$ be the statement\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}k=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\nNote that $P(n)$ is a *statement* about $n$; it asserts that $n$ has a particular property. The Principle of Mathematical Induction says that if we can prove tha the *Base Case* (PMI 1) is true and the *Inductive Step* (PMI 2) is true, then we may *conclude* that $(\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})P(n)$ is true, which is what we want.\n\n**Base Case:** *Show $P(1)$ is true.*\n$P(1)$ is the statement\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{1}k=\\frac{1(1+1)}{2},\n$$\nand our task is to prove that $P(1)$ is true. Thus, we must compute both quantities\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{1}k \\text{ and } \\frac{1(1+1)}{2}\n$$\nindividually, and then we must verify that these quantities are equal. Note that\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{1}k=1\n$$\nby definition. Also note that\n$$\n\\frac{1(1+1)}{2}=\\frac{2}{2}=1\n$$\nSo we see that\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{1}k=\\frac{1(1+1)}{2}\n$$\ni.e., $P(1)$ is true.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Prove statement (PMI 2). Let's begin with a Given-Goal diagram\n\n| Given | Goal |\n| --- | --- |\n| $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ arbitrary | |\n| $P(m)$ is true | $P(m+1)$ is true |\n\nwhich we rewrite as\n\n| Given | Goal |\n| --- | --- |\n| $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ arbitrary | |\n| $\\sum_{k=1}^{m}k=\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$  | $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}k=\\frac{(m+1)((m+1)+1)}{2}$ |\n\nWe will *use the Given* (called the *Inductive Hypothesis*), which says that\n$$\n\\tag{3.1}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m}k=\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\n$$\nto help us *prove our Goal*, which says that\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}k=\\frac{(m+1)((m+1)+1)}{2}\n$$\nWe may rewrite our Goal as\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}k=\\frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{To prove an equality, we must pick one side and attempt to}}\n$$\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{manipulate legally until we reach the other side.}}\n$$\nWe'll start with $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}k$. The key point in the proof is that, since $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, \n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}k=1+2+\\dots+(m+1)\n$$\n$$\n= (1+2+\\dots+m)+(m+1);\n$$\ni.e.,\n$$\n\\tag{3.2}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}k=(\\sum_{k=1}^{m}k)+(m+1)\n$$\nby the associative property of addition. Equation (3.2) shows us clearly where the Inductive Hypothesis (3.1) will be useful; namely, we may replace $\\sum_{k=1}^{m}k$ by $\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. From here, the computation should be routine.\n\nIn our formal writeup of this proof by induction, pay close attention to the *format* of our proof, which we'll use in all proofs by induction.\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Proposition 3.1.3.|Proposition 3.1.3.]]\n\nNote that the idea of proof by induction is the same idea used when making an \"inductive\" or \"recursive\" definition. For example, the familiar function $2^n$, where $n\\geq 0$ is an integer, is defined by recursion as follows:\n$$\n2^0=1\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\text{for all } m\\geq 0, \\quad 2^{m+1}=2 \\cdot 2^m\n$$\nNote that, just as with a proof by induction, a recursive definition has a *base case* (sometimes more than one) and an *inductive step*, which in a recursive definition is often called the *recursive step*. Not surprisingly, one often uses proof by induction to prove statements about concepts that are defined recursively.\n\nThe factorial function $n!$ is also defined by recursion on $n\\geq 0$:\n$$\n0!=1\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\text{for all } m\\geq 0, (m+1)!=(m+1)m!\n$$\nFor example (showing all steps in the recursion),\n$$\n5! = 5 \\cdot 4!\n$$\n$$\n\\quad = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3!\n$$\n$$\n\\quad = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2!\n$$\n$$\n\\quad = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1!\n$$\n$$\n\\quad = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0!\n$$\n$$\n\\quad = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1, \\quad \\text{ since $0!=1$; i.e.,}\n$$\n$$\n5! = 120\n$$\nNotice also that in a recursive definition or proof by induction, the base case need not correspond to $n=1$, as it did in [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Proposition 3.1.3.|Proposition 3.1.3.]], nor to $n=0$, as it did in the recursive definition above. Thus, we can state a more general version of the Principle of Mathematical Induction.\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Theorem 3.1.4. (Principle of Mathematical Induction (modified))|Theorem 3.1.4.

More precisely, a sequence is given by a function defined on the positive integers. For example, the function $a(n)=\\frac{1}{n}$, for $n\\geq 1$, defines the sequence\n$$\n1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\dots\n$$\nIn general we write $a_{n}$, rather than $a(n)$, and a sequence\n$$\na_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\dots\n$$\nis denoted by $\\{a_{n}\\}^{\\infty}_{n=1}$ \n\nConsider the following recursively defined sequence $\\{a_{n}\\}^{\\infty}_{n=1}$ \n$$\na_{1}=1,\n$$\n$$\na_{2}=5,\n$$\n$$\n\\text{for all } n\\geq 2, a_{n+1} = a_{n} + 2a_{n+1}\n$$\n\nLet's try to guess a formula for $a_{n}$. Computing the first few integers in the sequence shows that\n$$\na_{3}=a_{2}+2a_{1}=5+2(1)=7\n$$\n$$\na_{4}=a_{3}+2a_{2}=7+2(5)=17\n$$\n$$\na_{5}=a_{4}+2a_{3} = 17 + 2(7) = 31\n$$\n$$\na_{6} = a_{5} + 2a_{4} = 31 + 2(17) = 65\n$$\nNote that these numbers are almost, but not quite, powers of 2:\n$$\na_{1}=1=2^1-1\n$$\n$$\na_{2}=5=2^2+1\n$$\n$$\na_{3}=7=2^3-1\n$$\n$$\na_{4}=17=2^3+1\n$$\n$$\na_{5}=31=2^5-1\n$$\n$$\na_{6}=65=2^6+1\n$$\nThus, a reasonable guess is that\n$$\na_{n}=2^n+(-1)^n \\quad \\text{ for } n\\geq 1\n$$\nThis formula is called a *closed formula* for the recursively defined sequence; i.e., it describes $a_{n}$ as a function of $n$.\n\nHow can we prove that our closed formula is correct? It seems clear that induction is needed; the recursive definition has abase case (in fact, two of them) and an inductive step. However, the inductive step seems problematic. If we set up the inductive step according to PMI, then we have the following Given-Goal diagram.\n\n| Given | Goal |\n| --- | --- |\n| $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+} \\ (m\\geq 2)$ | |\n| $a_{m+1}=a_{m}+2a_{m-1}$ | |\n| $a_{m} = 2^m + (-1)^m$ (IH) | $a_{m+1} = 2^{m+1} + (-1)^{m+1}$ |\n\nHowever, the inductive step in the recursive definition defines $a_{m+1}$ in terms of *two* predecessors ($a_{m}$ and $a_{m-1}$) , rather than the usual one predecessor $a_{m}$. Our usual inductive hypothesis will give us information about $a_{m}$, but no information about $a_{m+1}$.

The language of sets","content":"\n# Previous\n[[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/3.2. Strong Induction|3.2. Strong Induction]]\n# Introduction\n\nSets occur everywhere in mathematics and other subjects whose foundations are mathematical. We have been using the word \"set\" since Chapter 1, but we have never defined what this word means. In many ways, this situation cannot be avoided. Take a moment now to try to define what you mean by a \"set\" ... Do you find yourself saying something like \"a collection of objects\"? Can you define *mathematically* what this means? Of course not; \"collection\" is just as mathematically vague as \"set\"!\n\nJust as Euclid took concepts such as \"point\" and \"line\" in geometry as *basic* or *undefined*, we will (for now) take the concept of \"set\" to be undefined. We will insist that for any particular set $A$, membership in $A$ (i.e., whether an object is in the set $A$ or not) must be well-defined (i.e., for any fixed object $x$ in the underlying universe under discussion, the answer to the question, \"is $x$ in $A$?\" must be either always \"yes\" or always \"no\", regardless of when the question is asked). As we have done since Chapter 1, we will use the notation $\\in$ to denote membership in a set.\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Notation 4.1.1.|Notation 4.1.1.]]\n\nThere are several ways that one can specify or describe a set. One way is to explicitly list its elements inside a pair of curly braces, such as\n$$\nA = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\{2,4,6,\\dots\\}\n$$\nHere, $B$ appears to be the set of positive integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, and $C$ appears to be the set of even positive integers. The notation \"$\\dots$\", however, is imprecise. We are inferring from the information given that the underlying *universal* set is the set $\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ of positive integers (recall our discussion of universal sets in [[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/1.1. Language and Logic|1.1. Language and Logic]].3) and that the patterns we see exhibited in the sets $B$ and $C$ continue.\n\nA more precise way of describing a set is to use \"set-builder\" notation to specify the precise property that the elements of the set should satisfy. This description is sometimes called a *conditional definition* of the set.\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Notation 4.1.2.|Notation 4.1.2.]]\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Example 4.1.3.|Example 4.1.3.]]\n\nWe have already made a very reasonable assumption about sets, namely, that a set is uniquely determined by its elements (the *Axiom of Extensionality* in formal, axiomatic set theory). The unique set with no elements is denoted by $\\emptyset$ and is called the *empty set* or *null set*. It is important to note right away that $\\emptyset$ is different from $\\{\\emptyset\\}$. (Be sure you can explain why!)\n\nThe assumption that a set is uniquely determined by its elements provides the definition of what it means for two sets to be equal ([[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Definition 4.1.6.|Definition 4.1.6.]]); namely, two sets are equal if they have the same elements. Before working more this this idea, we first define what is means for one set to be \"contained\" in another set.\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Definition 4.1.4.|Definition 4.1.4.]]\n\nTake a moment to write the definition of $A \\nsubseteq B$ symbolically, by forming a useful denial of (4.4). You'll find this symbolic representation useful when writing proofs.\n\n![[notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Example 4.1.5.|Example 4.1.5.]]\n# Exercises\n# Next\n#review","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.364561905Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Basic-Properties-of-Integers-1.2.3":{"title":"Basic Properties of Integers 1.2.3","content":"\nFor all integers a, b, c\n\n| Property | Definition |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Closure under + and $\\cdot$** | $a + b$ and $ab$ are also integers |\n| **Associative properties** | $(a + b) + c = a + (b+c)$ and $(ab)c = a(bc)$ |\n| **Commutative properties** | $a + b = b + a$ and $ab = ba$ |\n| **Distributive properties** | $a(b+c)=ab+ac$ |\n| **Identities** | $0 \\ne 1$, $a+0=a$, $a \\cdot 1 = a$, and $a \\cdot 0 = 0$ |\n| **Additive inverses** | There is a unique integer $-a=-1 \\cdot a$ such that $a + (-a) =0$ |\n| **Subtraction** | $b-a$ is defined equal to $b + (-a)$ |\n| **No divisors of 0** | If $ab = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ |\n| **Cancellation** | If $ab = ac$ and $a \\ne 0$, then $b = c$|\n| **Transitive property of \u003c** | If $a \u003c b$ and $b \u003c c$, then $a \u003c c$ |\n| **Trichotomy** | Exactly one of $a \u003c b$ or $a = b$ or $a \u003e b$ holds |\n| **Order property 1** | If $a \u003c b$ , then $a + c \u003c b + c$ |\n| **Order property 2** | If $c \u003e 0$ , then $a \u003c b$ iff $ac \u003c bc$ |\n| **Order property 3** | If $c \u003c 0$ , then $a \u003c b$ iff $ac \u003e bc$ |\n\nNote in particular the cancellation property of integers; there is no division operation in the integers.

In a way that can be made mathematically precise (see \\[16]), the more alternations of quantifiers such a statement has, the more complicated the statement is. Mathematical concepts whose definitions involve mixed quantifiers are very common in calculus and real analysis. For example, the statement that there is a rational number between any two distinct real numbers is expressed as follows:\n$$\n(\\forall x,y\\in\\mathbb{R})(\\exists z\\in\\mathbb{Q})[x\u003cy\\implies x\u003cz\u003cy]\n$$\nAn important concept involving mixed quantifiers that is studied in calculus is the notion of *limit*. Working informally for the moment, beginning students in calculus often think of the statement $\\lim_{ n \\to a }f(x)=L$ as meaning that the values of the function $f$ get \"closer and closer\" to the number $L$ when the value $x$ gets \"closer and closer\" to the number $a$.

The following is a well-known example of a \"proof\" that all horses are the same color.\n\t1. Let $P(n)$ denote the statement. \"For every set of $n$ horses, all the horses in the set are the same color.\" We \"prove\" $(\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+})P(n)$ by indication on $n$. Note that $P(1)$ is true, since for any set containing a single horse, all the horses in that set have the same color, namely the color of that single horse. Next, let $m\\geq 1$ and assume that $P(m)$ is true, i.e., that for any set of $m$ horses, all the horses in the set are the same color. We prove that $P(m+1)$ is true. Let $S$ be a set of $m+1$ horses named $x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{m+1}$. Now the horses $x_{1},x_{2},..,x_{m}$ are a set of $m$ horses, so by the Inductive Hypothesis, all the horses $x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{m}$ in this set have the same color. Furthermore, the horses $x_{1},x_{3},\\dots,x_{m+1}$ (i.e., all the horses except for horse $x_{2}$) are a set of $m$ horses, so by the Inductive Hypothesis, all the horses $x_{1},x_{3},\\dots,x_{m+1}$ in this set have the same color. It follows that all of the $m+1$ horses $x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{m+1}$ are the same color, since they are all the same color as horse $x_{1}$. Thus, $P(m+1)$ is true. It follows by PMI that $P(n)$ is true for all $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$; i.e., all horses have the same color. What's wrong with this proof?","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.368561991Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Mathematics/TTOMR/Exercises-3.2":{"title":"Exercises 3.2","content":"\n1.

Wolfe, Ph.D. on Twitter: I have recently given some long-form lectures on language models, how they work, and the AI lands...\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-twitter-com-cwolferesearch-status-1690094725699710976-189e7ac64a7)\n[Read Original](https://twitter.com/cwolferesearch/status/1690094725699710976)\n\n# State\n#Omnivore/inbox\n\n# Content\nI have recently given some long-form lectures on language models, how they work, and the AI landscape, which has given me a chance to more clearly organize key concepts for understanding language models. Here are the 15 key concepts that I’ve arrived at so far… AI Basics/History: LLMs aren’t everything, and there is a lot of AI research surrounding them. 1\\. (Self-)supervised learning techniques have a common framework, including a task, a model, some data, and a training algorithm. 2\\. AI has a long history (dating back to the early 20th century) of leveraging this framework to solve important problems. 3\\. Deep learning (and language models, which are a small subset of deep learning) is an area of AI that has become especially successful due to the ability to leverage large-scale data/compute. Language Model Fundamentals: How do we create a good base model? 4\\. The transformer architecture (and self-attention) is a fundamental advancement that empowered the recent explosion of language models. 5\\. Using decoder-only transformers and next-token prediction, we can pre-train language models to gain a vast amount of knowledge and linguistic understanding. 6\\. After pre-training, we have a foundation model that can be used to solve various tasks via in-context learning. 7\\. To make these foundation models as good as possible, we need both large models (many parameters) and as much data as possible (i.e., large models alone are not enough). Modern Language Models: How do we go from a good base model to something like ChatGPT? 8\\. Next-token prediction is not enough to create something like ChatGPT. Base Model output can be repetitive and uninteresting. We need to align the model to human desires/expectations. 9\\. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) performs alignment by fine-tuning the model (using next-token prediction) on examples of good responses to prompts. 10\\. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns the language model directly based on human feedback to its responses. 11\\. The best/top language models today are extensively aligned via a combination of SFT and RLHF. Applying Language Models: How to we apply language models to solving specific problems? 12\\. Fine-tuning language models (using next-token prediction) on in-domain data is a great way to specialize these models for a specific application domain. 13\\. In-domain fine-tuning is not always necessary because there is a lot we can accomplish via in-context learning! 14\\. Especially when the underlying model is steerable, a lot can be done with more basic prompting techniques, such as zero/few-shot and instruction prompting. 15\\. We should only use advanced prompting approaches after empirically confirming that we cannot solve a problem with simpler techniques. Start simple, perform tests, and add complexity only as needed.\n\n[ ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sBnPNHiKzGTALvuIB7qOhCE6TM0rGNOs2qTepdnnfyF4/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F3RrTIfWkAAV64E.jpg?name=small\u0026format=webp) ](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F3RrTIfWkAAV64E.jpg?name=small\u0026format=webp)\n\nFor more details, I also created this GitHub gist with links to the main topics I’ve written about on language models.

Tap the Menu icon next to the link you wish to archive (on the mobile app, long press the link to open the menu).\n2. Select **Archive**.\n3. The link will disappear from the default Library view, but will show up if you select the Archived filter (see Filters below).\n\n### **Labels** \n\n1. Tap the Menu icon next to any link and select **Set Label**s.\n2. Select an existing label from the list or tap **Edit Labels** to create a new one.\n3. The label will appear next to the link in your Library. Tap it to view all links with the same label.\n4. _Omnivore mobile app only_: tap **Labels** to see a complete list of all labels you have used; tap one to view all links with the same label\n5. Note: Omnivore will automatically assign some labels, such as “Newsletters.”\n\n###  Search \n\n1. To search through all your saved links, enter a keyword or phrase in the search bar.\n2. You can combine keywords with labels and filters to focus your search even further. [Learn more about advanced search](https://omnivore.app/help/search).\n\n###  Filters \n\n1. Use the **Filters** menu to refine your Library view (some filters may be visible by default).\n2. Select **Read Later** to view a list of all your non-archived links except Newsletters.\n3. Select **Highlights** to view the text selections you have highlighted in all your saved pages.\n4. Select **Today** to view a list of links you saved today.\n5. Select **Newsletters** to view links saved via your newsletter subscriptions.\n\n##  Integrations \n\n Omnivore allows integrations with knowledge bases and note-taking apps including: \n\n* Logseq\n* Webhooks\n\n###  Logseq \n\nWith Omnivore's Logseq plugin you can sync all your saved articles, highlights, and notes into Logseq, a popular knowledge base. For information on setting up and using the Logseq plugin, please refer to this helpful [Omnivore for Logseq Plugin Guide](https://briansunter.com/graph/#/page/omnivore-logseq-guide). \n\n###  Webhooks \n\nOmnivore can trigger webhooks when you save a link or add highlights to a page you are reading. [This example](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/syncing-all-your-notes-to-google) shows webhooks being used to write all saved links to a Google Sheets spreadsheet stored on a Google Drive. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.368561991Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Omnivore/2023-08-11/Hey-whats-up":{"title":"Hey, what's up-","content":"\n# Hey, what's up?\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/hey-what-s-up-189e7754043)\n[Read Original](https://omnivore.app/no_url?q=3e492a23-b2b8-4fa2-9ba8-82961df614e3)\n\n# State\n#Omnivore/completed\n\n# Content\nHey friend 👋\n\nIt’s **_RAD_** to have you here.\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/300x0,s02RyJ5J_cH52KWkywCutNfQTGtNaTOhA8pZmGLSVHjY/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/taWn4dpmSgXWHgFvLFdWSc/email)\n\nWe use that word often here, friend.\n\n\"Rad\" is our homage to _The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ (and 90’s surf-skate culture).\n\nBut really it's because of this definition:\n\nAnd you, my friend, **are effortlessly cool.**\n\nNow that we’ve established that, you’re probably wondering:\n\nWhy am I here?\n\nWhat’s in it for me?\n\nWe gotchu.

Just tell us **by hitting REPLY** and share your aliveness. Family, hobbies, causes, learning and art are all super valid answers.\n\nHere’s my answer.\n\nEvery morning, my daughter's tiny hand guides me through our neighborhood and to kindergarten.

I make a new markdown file to serve as an index using this code block:\n\n```applescript\n```dataview\ntable without id\n\tlist(file.name, url) as \"article\", list(date_published, author, hl) as \"info \u0026 excerpts\"\nfrom #Omnivore \nwhere date_published \nsort date_published desc, date_saved desc\n```\n\n```\n\nThis creates a table with a list of the articles sorted in reverse chronological order (ie. the most recent one is at the top), and includes any excerpts which you have highlighted in Omnivore.\n\nIt ends up looking like this:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sFhM75rcUW6JSI1ss6AjBldDB-jwP10uiy59aDcbC35o/https://media.infosec.town/media/153d6e57-3c14-4447-9c25-10702dcb0a71.png)\n\nI also edited the Article Template above so that any annotations I add to a highlight can be displayed as a footnote beneath the excerpt, like this:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sT_fjBWmyCAMyjnAv0P4GWFbkyk-bsib_BaCVkq7FVHs/https://media.infosec.town/media/2c9549d0-eecc-4763-a6bc-863e21c62cb7.png)\n\nSome of the articles you save will inevitably not have properly formatted `date_published` info — those are currently excluded from the above code block. I put another code block beneath that one which looks like this:\n\n```applescript\n```dataview\ntable without id\n\tlist(file.name, url) as \"article\", list(date_published, author, hl) as \"info \u0026 excerpts\"\nfrom #Omnivore \nwhere date_published = null\nsort date_published desc, date_saved desc\n```\n\n```\n\nOmnivore also has an “edit info” option for each article saved, so if you'd like to move an article without `date_published` info into its proper spot in the table which is sorted by date, you can open it in a browser and edit the article's date info. (This date-editing option currently appears to only be available in a web browser, not on the mobile app.)\n\nYou can also make more specialized lists of this sort by using Omnivore's “tags” feature editing the line so it reads `from #Omnivore and #[NewTag]` – I have also found that Omnivore supports the use of [nested tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags#Nested+tags), which can help narrow or broaden the specificity of various index tables :)\n\n---\n\nP.S. – if you want quick \u0026 easy access to the markdown articles via these index files, just remove the snippet of text which says `without id` from the code block. That will create an extra column which is a direct link to the markdown file, like this:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sAfUMy-4yHwxYjz9JBfGF7_YX0c1cF4sBJhzvRc-3FaA/https://media.infosec.town/media/70afa052-2fed-4951-a26e-fc3d0012bde2.png)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.368561991Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Omnivore/2023-08-11/Omnivore-Chrome-Web-Store":{"title":"Omnivore - Chrome Web Store","content":"\n# Omnivore - Chrome Web Store\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-chrome-google-com-webstore-detail-omnivore-blkggjdmcfjdbmm-189e76e45db)\n[Read Original](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnivore/blkggjdmcfjdbmmmlfcpplkchpeaiiab/related)\n\n# State\n#Omnivore/completed\n\n# Content\nOverview\n\nSave PDFs and Articles to your Omnivore library\n\nDistraction free.

It was like a new adventure, filled with excitement and wonder about what treasures might lie ahead … but I was also _constantly_ worried and confused:\n\n* Is this even going to work?\n* Am I just wasting my time?\n* What direction do I go down?\n* What if I become a complete failure?\n\n​  \nIt was a constant push and pull, mentally. Every time I felt discouraged I just said to myself, “I wish this was easy.”\n\n_Can you relate?_\n\nFor over a decade, I’ve helped tens of thousands of motivated people like you find direction and create life-changing businesses. \n\nThe one thing they all had in common? \n\n_Obstacles!_ \n\nI haven’t met one creator or entrepreneur who hasn’t faced significant obstacles.\n\nBut there’s a big difference between those who give up on their dreams and those who persevere.\n\nThe difference is having the right support to help you through the obstacles you face. At SPI, we help you with those obstacles in several different ways.\n\n## Get Unstuck\n\nEvery week, we send you the _Unstuck_ newsletter, which brings you a story and a related challenge that is specifically designed to help you overcome a specific obstacle. Read the story and take the challenge to break through what is holding you back.\n\n_Unstuck_ comes out every Tuesday. Along with the weekly story, you'll also find links to upcoming events at SPI, a cool sponsor we think you'll like, and my Dad Joke of the Week. Trust me, you don't want to miss it.\n\n## Together Is Better\n\nWhen you signed up to connect with me and the SPI team we asked you an important question: \n\n**What’s your #1 challenge** _**right now**_ **when it comes to online business?** \n\nThis is _your_ first step on this new pathway, and our first step in knowing how to best serve and guide you. So, if you didn’t answer already, here it is:\n\n**What is the biggest thing getting in your way from achieving your business goals?** \n\nAnswering this question helps us tailor the advice we send you to your business needs. \n\n​\n\nIf you’re like many entrepreneurs, you’re drawn to the freedom that entrepreneurship offers.\n\nFreedom to do what you want, when you want, with who you want. It doesn’t require a million-dollar business or millions of subscribers to achieve. It requires a clear direction, support from the right people, and _access to help when you need it_. \n\nAnd that’s exactly what SPI offers. Our company is built on the idea that **together is better.** \n\nWhen there are more people working toward a common goal, _everyone_ is more likely to achieve it. Science proves it, and the results from our own students do too.\n\n## Free Content and Events\n\nSPI’s content, courses, and communities equip entrepreneurs like you with the best resources in the world to find your way to success, and it all starts today. Make sure to [check out all the free downloads you now have access to](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmun82mnxxc6u9zdp6u6hdzdd400/dphehmu0z96elesl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc21hcnRwYXNzaXZlaW5jb21lLmNvbS9kb3dubG9hZHMv), including over four hours of webinars, two free challenges, and a bunch of cheat sheets to help keep you on track.  \n​  \nBe sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmun82mnxxc6u9zdp6u6hdzdd400/e0hph0u093v78qa7/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS90ZWFtc3Bp) and [LinkedIn](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmun82mnxxc6u9zdp6u6hdzdd400/7qh7h2uov2l9rzc9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2NvbXBhbnkvc3BpbWVkaWEv), and check out our [events page](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmun82mnxxc6u9zdp6u6hdzdd400/owhkhwur3m9w25hq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc21hcnRwYXNzaXZlaW5jb21lLmNvbS9ldmVudHM=) here for any upcoming events you can add to your calendar already.

You can also negate a label search to find pages that do not have a certain label. \n\n Some examples: \n\n* `label:Newsletter` finds all pages that have the label Newsletter\n* `label:Cooking,Fitness` finds all your pages with either the Cooking or Fitness labels\n* `label:Newsletter label:Surfing` finds all pages with both the Newsletter and Surfing labels\n* l`abel:Coding -label:News` finds all pages with the Coding label that do not have the News label\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.368561991Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Omnivore/2023-08-11/Random-note-Obsidian-Help":{"title":"Random note - Obsidian Help","content":"\n# Random note - Obsidian Help\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-help-obsidian-md-plugins-random-note-189e6542da6)\n[Read Original](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Random+note)\n\n# State\n#Omnivore/completed\n\n# Content\n[](https://help.obsidian.md/Home)[Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Home)\n\nGetting started\n\nImport notes\n\nUser interface\n\nEditing and formatting\n\nLinking notes and files\n\nFiles and folders\n\nPlugins\n\n[Core plugins](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Core+plugins)\n\n[Audio recorder](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Audio+recorder)\n\n[Backlinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks)\n\n[Bookmarks](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Bookmarks)\n\n[Canvas](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas)\n\n[Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)\n\n[Daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes)\n\n[File explorer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/File+explorer)\n\n[File recovery](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/File+recovery)\n\n[Format converter](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Format+converter)\n\n[Graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view)\n\n[Note composer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Note+composer)\n\n[Outgoing links](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Outgoing+links)\n\n[Outline](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Outline)\n\n[Page preview](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Page+preview)\n\n[Quick switcher](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Quick+switcher)\n\n[Random note](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Random+note)\n\n[Search](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search)\n\n[Slash commands](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Slash+commands)\n\n[Slides](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Slides)\n\n[Tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Tags)\n\n[Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates)\n\n[Unique note creator](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Unique+note+creator)\n\n[Word count](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Word+count)\n\n[Workspaces](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Workspaces)\n\n[Importer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Importer)\n\nObsidian Publish\n\nObsidian Sync\n\nExtending Obsidian\n\nContributing to Obsidian\n\nLicenses and payment\n\nConcepts\n\nCustomization\n\nObsidian\n\n[Help and support](https://help.obsidian.md/Help+and+support)\n\n[Home](https://help.obsidian.md/Home)\n\n[Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Home)\n\nRandom note\n\nThe Random note plugin opens a random note within your vault.

If you don’t already have an Omnivore account, you can sign up for free from the login screen. \n\n_Note:_ If you haven’t installed the iOS app, download it here: \u003chttps://omnivore.app/install/ios\u003e \n\n## **Step 2: Add Omnivore to your Share menu favorites.** \n\n Start by viewing the Share menu from within any supported iOS app (we’ve used Safari for this example). \n\n1. Tap the **Share** icon at the bottom of the screen.\n2. Swipe left to the end of the list of app icons and tap **More**.\n3. Tap **Edit** at the top of the screen.\n4. Scroll down until you see the **Omnivore** icon and tap the **+** icon next to it.\n5. Press and hold the three-bar icon and drag Omnivore to one of the top positions under Favorites. Tap **Done** to close the menu.\n6. **Omnivore** will appear as one of the first options the next time you use the Share feature (you may need to restart Safari).\n\n## **Step 3: Save links to your Omnivore Library** \n\nStart by navigating to the page or article you wish to save. Please note that Omnivore will save the content that appears on your screen (not just a link), so _if the page is behind a paywall and you are logged into the paywalled site, you will save the paid content._ \n\n1. While viewing the page you’d like to save, tap the **Share** icon.\n2. Tap the **Omnivore** icon in the Share menu.\n3. Tag the article with one or more labels (optional) and tap **Read Now** or **Read Later**.\n4. If you choose Read Later, the link will appear in your Library the next time you open the Omnivore app.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.368561991Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Omnivore/2023-08-11/Shaped-to-roll-along-a-programmed-periodic-path":{"title":"Shaped to roll along a programmed periodic path","content":"\n# Shaped to roll along a programmed periodic path\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-t-co-k-zhg-edu-0-uo-ssr-true-189e7acde16)\n[Read Original](https://t.co/KZhgEdu0Uo?ssr=true)\n\n# State\n#Omnivore/completed\n\n# Content\n* NEWS AND VIEWS\n* 09 August 2023\n\n An algorithm has been developed for constructing a 3D shape that follows an infinitely repeating path as it rolls under gravity.

Two wheels connected by an axle have much less freedom — with no common point about which to rotate, they are forced to move along parallel straight lines forever. Trains use an ingenious method to solve this problem: their wheels are conical, so the wheel on the outside edge of a turn can keep up with the other wheel by riding the train track at the wide end of the cone. The outside wheel spins at the same rate as the inside wheel, but travels farther (see [go.nature.com/3jjykjc](http://go.nature.com/3jjykjc)). In this way, the track’s shape controls the train’s path.\n\n## Access options\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n$29.99 / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 51 print issues and online access\n\n$199.00 per year\n\nonly $3.90 per issue\n\nRent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\n### Additional access options:\n\n* [Log in](https://idp.nature.com/authorize/natureuser?client%5Fid=grover\u0026redirect%5Furi=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-02335-9)\n* [Learn about institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/license-options)\n* [Read our FAQs](https://support.nature.com/en/support/home)\n* [Contact customer support](https://www.springernature.com/gp/contact)\n\n_Nature_ **620**, 282-283 (2023)\n\n_doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02335-9_\n\n## References\n\n1.

But those glances have slowly become stares, and those stares have grown to encompass a major portion of our waking hours. \n\n The end result is the same person who spends 127 hours per year on Instagram (the [global average](http://www.businessinsider.com/people-spend-21-minutes-per-day-on-instagram-2014-10)) complains that she has “no time” for reading. \n\n The fact is, **the ability to read is becoming a source of competitive advantage in the world**. \n\n I’m not talking about basic literacy. What has become exceedingly scarce (and therefore, valuable) is the physical, emotional, attentional, and mental capability to sit quietly and direct focused attention for sustained periods of time. \n\n A [recent article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/overloaded-circuits-why-smart-people-underperform) in the Harvard Business Review puts a name to this new neurological phenomenon: Attention Deficit Trait. Basically, the terms ADD and ADHD are falling out of use because effectively the entire population fits the diagnostic criteria. It’s not a condition anymore, it’s a _trait_ — the inherent and unavoidable experience of modern life characterized by “distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience.” \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sCKKsi_KsyhXjSRvn7hvFRJEjLKQkBiJU0agepFckkI4/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/oP2q5jihy5hj474ZFtvPjw/3edWskTMDwFhuVEtauLv5X)\n\n Start Building Your Second Brain \n\n Subscribe below to learn more about the next cohort of the Building a Second Brain course \n\n###  Read It. Later. \n\n Before I explain the massive, under-appreciated benefits these apps provide, and how to use them most effectively, a quick primer in case you’re unfamiliar. \n\n So-called “Read It Later” apps give you the ability to “save” content on the web for later consumption. They are essentially advanced bookmarking apps, pulling in the content from a page to be read or viewed in a cleaner, simpler visual layout. \n\n On top of that core function they add features like favoriting, tags, search, cross-platform syncing, recommended content, offline viewing, and archiving. The most popular options are: \n\n* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)\n* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/a/)\n* [Send to Kindle](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea?hl=en) (for sending articles to your Kindle)\n* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) (for those RSS fans)\n* and [Safari’s built-in “Add to Reading List” feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200294).\n\n The app I use, Pocket, adds a button to the Chrome toolbar that looks like this: \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/130x58,syYiQlMJ3hP3JyGS_AYz8D5Oq9FZ1QxR2ef29Fia7Ht0/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lk-DPDFjLslM4h2GAv8KIA.png?resize=130%2C58\u0026ssl=1) \n\n Chrome toolbar \n\n_Note: at time of writing, I was using Pocket, but have recently switched to Instapaper because of Pocket’s “Share to Evernote” bug mentioned below._ \n\n Clicking the button while viewing a webpage turns the button pink, and saves the page to your “list.” Navigating to getpocket.com, or opening the Pocket app on your computer or mobile device shows you a list of everything you’ve saved: \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/800x507,smjUUrOduWv7T0bCSx9oh_Ag0Yasq_HyFfgAoDXryOcM/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wkKD4oP3-kWJERxmBBI2cA.png?resize=800%2C507\u0026ssl=1) \n\n Mac desktop client \n\n You can also view your list in a “tile” layout on the web, making it into essentially a personalized magazine. Personalized, in this case, not by a cold, unfeeling algorithm, but by your past self: \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/800x478,sFjAZnzFiVzsVRlXF9QyD5dq_jzT69dsyyp3Bb-k5ZGU/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ug06oorCHGFpEzMyl9kfhg.png?resize=800%2C478\u0026ssl=1) \n\n Web browser “tile” view \n\n Marking an item as read in one version of the app will quickly sync across all platforms. It will also save your current progress on one device, so you can continue where you left off on a different device (for those longer pieces). \n\n###  The highest leverage point in a system is in the intake — the initial assumptions and paradigms that inform its development \n\n I’ve [written previously](https://medium.com/forte-labs/how-to-use-evernote-for-your-creative-workflow-f048f0aa3ed1) about how to use Evernote as a general reference filing system, not only to stay organized but to inspire creativity. \n\n But I didn’t address a key question when creating any workflow: how and from where does information enter the system? The quality of a workflow’s outputs is fundamentally limited by the quality of its inputs. Garbage in, garbage out. \n\n There are A LOT of ways we could talk about to improve the quality of the information you consume. But I want to focus now on the two that Read It Later apps can help with: \n\n1. Increasing consumption of long-form content (which is presumably more substantive)\n2. Better filtering\n\n###  #1 | Increasing Consumption of Long-Form Content \n\n In order to consume good ideas, first you have to consume many ideas. \n\n This is the fundamental flaw in the “information diet” advice from Tim Ferriss and others: strong filters work best on a larger initial flow. Using your friends as your primary filter for new ideas ensures you remain the dumbest person in the room, and contribute nothing to the conversation. \n\n The problem is that our entire digital world is geared toward snackable chunks of low-grade information — photos, tweets, statuses, snaps, feeds, cards, etc. To fight the tide you have to redesign your environment — you have to create affordances. \n\n\u003e Affordance (n.): a relation between an object and an organism that, through a collection of stimuli, **affords the opportunity for that organism to perform an action.** \n\n Let’s look at the 4 main barriers to consuming long-form content, and the affordances that Read It Later apps use to overcome them: \n\n####  1\\. App performance \n\n We know that the most infinitesimal delays in the loading time of a webpage will dramatically impact how many people stay on the page. [Google found](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/) that increasing the number of results per page from 10 to 30 took only half a second longer, but **caused 20% of people to drop off**. \n\n If you think your behavior is not affected by such trivialities, think again. Even on a subconscious level, you will resist even opening apps that don’t reward you with snappy response times. Which is a problem because the apps most people turn to for reading are either ebook apps like iBooks and Kindle, or web browsers like Chrome and Safari. I’m not sure which category is slower, but they’re both abysmal. \n\n Meanwhile, your snaps and instas refresh at precog-like speeds. \n\n Read It Later apps, by slurping in content (articles, videos, slideshows) into a clean interface, eliminate the culprits — ads, site analytics, popups — all the stuff you don’t care about. \n\n A [recent analysis](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/technology/personaltech/ad-blockers-mobile-iphone-browsers.html) by The New York Times of 3 leading ad-blockers (which have the same effect) measured a **21% increase in battery life**, and in the most egregious case of Boston.com, a drop in loading time **from 33 seconds to 7 seconds**. Many other leading sites were not that far off. \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/563x365,sFABKoLfIzSHIwYCEllG7t2i-uxewZOlI9ALe6-KJLSs/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vfmR5LKEjfx-0Lx-kWb4bw.png?resize=563%2C365\u0026ssl=1) \n\n Effect of ad-blocker on loading times of Boston.com, via [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/technology/personaltech/ad-blockers-mobile-iphone-browsers.html) \n\n Yeah that’s pretty much an eternity in mobile behavior land. \n\n####  2\\. Matching content with your context \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/507x676,sxG7LpsFKxnoEDDIOpwI06zJ3e8CoE30WZseOtRT8u6s/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*N15BlTDGq8kTc7HdGUmShA.png?resize=507%2C676\u0026ssl=1) \n\n My Pocket list on iPad \n\n Much of the time when we pull out our phone, we’re looking for something to match our mood (or energy, or time available, or other context). We use our constellation of shiny apps as mood regulators and self-soothers, as time-fillers and boredom-suppressors, for better or worse. \n\n So you need a little entertainment, and you open…an ebook? Yeah right. Monochrome pages don’t attract you. They don’t draw you in. \n\n Pocket gives reading some of this stimulatory pleasure by laying out your list in a pleasing, magazine-style layout (at left). Not only is it generally attractive, but it gives you that same magazine-flipping pleasure of engaging with something that interests you _right in that moment_. \n\n David Allen puts it this way: \n\n\u003e “It’s practical to have organized reading material at hand when you’re on your way to a meeting that may be starting late, a seminar that may have a window of time when nothing is going on, a dentist appointment that may keep you waiting, or, of course, if you’re going to have some time on a train or plane. Those are all great opportunities to browse and work through that kind of reading. People who don’t have their Read/Review material organized can waste a lot of time, since **life is full of weird little windows when it could be used.**” \n\n You’re not fighting your impulses forcing yourself to read a dense tome after a long work day. Willpower preserved ✓ \n\n####  3\\. Asynchronous reading \n\n This is one of the least understood barriers to reading in our fragmented timescape. \n\n There is something deeply, deeply unsatisfying about repeatedly starting something and not finishing it. This is what we experience all day at work, being continuously interrupted by a stream of “emergencies.” The last thing we want after a stressful day starved of wins is to fail even at reading an article. \n\n The [2015 revised edition (affiliate link)](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=fortelabs07-20\u0026linkId=fe6db72d8e5bbb38b1ea43241924f7e9\u0026language=en%5FUS) of _Getting Things Done_ [cites the work](http://users.wfu.edu/masicaej/MasicampoBaumeister2011JPSP.pdf) of Dr. Roy Baumeister, who has shown that “uncompleted tasks take up room in the mind, which then limits clarity and focus.” The risk of cognitive dissonance at not being able to finish a long article (much less a book) keep us from even beginning it. \n\n Read It Later apps address this by simply saving your progress in a given article, allowing you to pick back up at a different time, or on a different device, and clearly marking items as “read” once you’re finished. \n\n####  4\\. Focus \n\n A common response when I recommend people adopt _yet another_ category of apps is “Why don’t I just use Evernote?” Or whatever app they’re using for general reference or task management. Evernote even makes a Chrome extension called [Clearly](https://evernote.com/clearly/) for reading online content and [Web Clipper](https://evernote.com/webclipper/?downloaded) for saving it. \n\n It is a question of focus. Why don’t you use your task manager to keep track of content (i.e. “Read this article”)? Because the last thing you want to see when you cuddle up with your hot cocoa for some light reading is the hundreds of tasks you’re not doing. \n\n Likewise, the last thing you want to see when you (finally!) have time to read is the thousands of notes you’ve collected from every corner of the universe, only some of which you haven’t read, only some of which you _want_ to read, only some of which are _meant_ to be read. \n\n\u003e Actionable info ≠ Reference info ≠ To Read pile \n\n Ergo, \n\n\u003e Task manager ≠ Evernote ≠ Pocket \n\n###  #2 | Better filtering \n\n Now you’ve got the funnel filled. It’s time to narrow it. \n\n Most advice on this topic focuses on being more selective about your sources. Cutting out the email digests that just throw you off track, unfollowing people posting crap, or even [directly replacing ads with quality sources](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ad-replacer-turn-spammy-a/eckeeomlpacfhejaameopnmgipghaoam). \n\n The problem is that this assumes you are always at your best, always at 100% self-discipline, totally aligned with your life values, priorities ship shape. \n\n Yeah. \n\n In the moment, with your blood sugar at a negative value and every fiber of your being screaming for a dopamine hit, _of course_ that Buzzfeed article seems like the best conceivable use of your time. If you think you can permanently seal off your life from the celebrity news, content marketing, and spammy friends that dominate the web, the NSA has a job for you. \n\n Procrastination is the most powerful force in the universe. _It will find a way._ \n\n I have a different approach: **waiting periods**. Every time I come across something I may want to read/watch, I’m totally allowed to. No limits! The only requirement is I have to save it to Pocket, and then choose to consume it at a later time. \n\n I’ve found that even just clicking a link to open the URL, in order to save it to Pocket, is too much of a temptation. The first glimpse of a cute GIF and I’m off to Reddit, completely forgetting my morning email session. \n\n So instead I just **command-click** every link I’m interested in (or **right-click \u003e Open link in new tab**), which opens each link in a separate tab _without taking me to that tab_. \n\n Here’s what a typical Monday morning link-fest looks like, just from email: \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s6KkWg-OdGcQNuvOShcztrmaslDz3Cm5o9rD1eDOxxRc/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cLy09F0SPJJmi0WfazXi3Q.png?w=900\u0026ssl=1) \n\n Then, because I’m still in **collection mode**, not in read mode, I cycle through each tab one at a time (**shift-command-}** or **control-tab**), saving each one to Pocket using the shortcut I set up: **command-p** (chosen for irony and to avoid inadvertent printing). \n\n There’s only one rule: **NO READING OR WATCHING!** \n\n Bringing this back to filtering, not only am I saving time and preserving focus by batch processing both the collection and the consumption of new content, I’m **time-shifting the curation process** to a time better suited for reading, and (most critically) removed from the temptations, stresses, and biopsychosocial hooks that first lured me in. \n\n I am always amazed by what happens: no matter how stringent I was in the original collecting, no matter how certain I was that this thing was worthwhile, I **regularly eliminate 1/3 of my list before reading**. The post that looked SO INTERESTING when compared to that one task I’d been procrastinating on, in retrospect isn’t even something I care about. \n\n What I’m essentially doing is creating a buffer. Instead of pushing a new piece of info through from intake to processing to consumption without any scrutiny, I’m creating a pool of options drawn from a longer time period, which allows me to make decisions from a higher perspective, where those decisions are much better aligned with what truly matters to me. \n\n\u003e Remove any feature, process, or effort that does not directly contribute to the learning you seek. — Eric Ries, The Leader’s Guide \n\n Here’s a visual of how this works, from my Pocket analytics: \n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,stGbUueP6GB86OSUIreA-v1CvD10SF4A-ecLznSBpGQc/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YRExWXbhPma8-AcWP_KSrw.png?w=900\u0026ssl=1) \n\n You can see that I save more things toward the beginning of the week and the weekend, and then draw down the buffer more towards the end of the week. \n\n**_/sidebar_** \n\n Imagine for a second if we could do this with everything. On Saturday morning, well-rested and wise, you retroactively decide everything you _want to have done_ during the previous week. Anything you decide was not worthwhile, you _get that time back_. \n\n I experienced this recently with email — after returning from a 10-day meditation course during which I was completely off the grid, I was surprised to notice it took only 1.9 hours to process almost 2 weeks’ worth of email (I track these things). I normally spend on average 2.19 hours on email **per week** — _what happened to those extra 2.48 hours?!_ Besides the gains from batch processing such a large quantity of emails at once, I believe the main factor was that I evaluated my emails from a longer time horizon and higher perspective, more correctly judging whether something was worth responding to or acting on. \n\n If only this method would scale. \n\n**/end\\_sidebar** \n\n###  Mo’ apps, mo’ problems \n\n There are drawbacks, which I’ve glossed over until now. The two main ones: \n\n####  1\\. Formatting issues \n\n Many sites, including popular ones, aren’t presented correctly within the Pocket app (and I imagine others). There’s always the option of opening the link in a web browser, but this eliminates all the positive affordances and then some. If there wasn’t so much value provided otherwise, this would be a deal breaker. \n\n The worst part is that, sometimes, the article is cut off or links don’t appear _without any indication that something is amiss_. On Tim Ferriss’ blog, for example, links (of which there are many) are simply removed. \n\n One solution is to tag problematic items with “desktop” so you know that these need to be read/viewed on your computer. \n\n####  2\\. Dependence \n\n Every productivity tool eventually becomes a victim of its own success. In this case, I’ve become so dependent on Pocket that bugs really affect me. \n\n For example, the Share to Evernote feature, which I use to highlight and save key passages, has been broken for at least a month. My hysterical tweets to Pocket Support have been answered but not resolved. \n\n You wouldn’t think such a minor feature within one app could be so disruptive, but it has been massively so. This simple workflow: \n\n_Highlight \u003e Share \u003e Share to Evernote \u003e Save_ \n\n …has been replaced with this: \n\n_Highlight \u003e Copy \u003e Switch to Evernote \u003e New note \u003e Paste \u003e Switch back to Pocket \u003e Share \u003e More \u003e Copy URL \u003e Switch back to Evernote \u003e Paste URL \u003e Switch back to Pocket_ \n\n Worse, I often forget to go back and grab the URL, so I have to hunt it down at some later date. \n\n**/rant\\_over** \n\n###  Progress Traps and Paradigms \n\n The amount of information in the world is a [progress trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress%5Ftrap). Too much stuff to read is just as limiting as too little. \n\n As the inimitable Venkatesh Rao [has written](http://breakingsmart.com/season-1/), we’re moving from a world of **containers** (companies, departments, semesters, packages, silos) to a world of **streams** (social networks, info feeds, main streets of thriving cities, Twitter). Problems and opportunities alike resist having neat little boxes drawn around them. There’s way too much to absorb. Way too much to even guess what you don’t know. \n\n As the pace of change in the world accelerates, we double down on all the methods that created the problems in the first place — more planning, more forecasting, more control and risk management. We’re left with massive institutions that nobody trusts, that are simultaneously brittle and too-big-to-fail, creating precarity at every level of the socioeconomic pyramid. \n\n What would it look like instead to solve problems (and explore opportunities) in a way that gets better the faster we go? \n\n I can’t do justice to Rao’s blog series linked above (it’s in 20 parts — may want to save it for later ;), but the first step he proposes is “exposing yourself to as many different diverse streams as possible.” \n\n When you’re immersed in a stream, the faster it goes, the more novel perspectives and ideas you’re exposed to. You develop an [opposable mind](http://rogerlmartin.com/lets-read/the-opposable-mind) — the ability to juggle and play around with different perspectives on any issue, instead of seeing it through one lens. \n\n Increasingly, the only metric that will matter in your journey of personal growth will be **ROL: Rate-of-Learning**. We’ve heard a lot in recent years about the importance of hands-on learning and practical experimentation. We get it. Burying your head in a book by itself gets you nowhere. \n\n But the pendulum is swinging too far in that direction. Yes, you can be _too_ action-oriented. Ideas, while cheap when compared to effective execution, are still more valuable than many of the other things we spend time on. \n\n There’s another way to learn faster: assimilate and build on the ideas of others. Sure, you won’t understand every tacit lesson their experience gave them, but you can incorporate many of them, and in a fraction of the time it would take you to make every mistake yourself. \n\n Ideas are high leverage agents. They become more so when arranged in highly cross-referenced networks. The only tool we have available that is capable of both creating and accessing these networks on demand is the human brain. \n\n I lied before. There is one form of leverage even more powerful than the initial assumptions and paradigms that inform a system’s development: the **ability to transcend paradigms**. \n\n I can’t put it any better than Donella Meadows, in her [seminal piece](http://www.donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/) on complex systems: \n\n\u003e People who cling to paradigms (which means just about all of us) take one look at the spacious possibility that everything they think is guaranteed to be nonsense and pedal rapidly in the opposite direction. Surely there is no power, no control, no understanding, not even a reason for being, much less acting, in the notion or experience that there is no certainty in any worldview. But, in fact, everyone who has managed to entertain that idea, for a moment or for a lifetime, has found it to be the basis for radical empowerment. **If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever one will help to achieve your purpose.** \n\n\u003e It is in this space of mastery over paradigms that people throw off addictions, live in constant joy, bring down empires, get locked up or burned at the stake or crucified or shot, and **have impacts that last for millennia**. \n\n\u003e In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with **strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.** \n\n Reading is the closest thing we have to thinking another’s thoughts.

Some of it has been about tools for thought and personal knowledge management. Some express more general arguments for spending less time fiddling with the tools and actually making sure to get work done. Others are more specific. \"2023 is the year I'm gonna settle on _one_ tool. Not just yet sure if that's gonna be Tana, Obisidian, Logseq, Remnote, or something else.\"\n\nThe underlying notion is clear.\n\nYou either spend time tinkering with your tools and get no real work done.\n\nOr you just let the tool fade into the back and start to deliver.\n\nI would beg to differ: The sweet spot is somewhere in between. But also that the problem people hint at isn't so much about switching tools as it is switching workflows and processes.\n\n## Notetaking is a skill\n\nI've spent 23 years as a \"knowledge worker\". The first 20 were as a journalist and the last three as a project manager. How many pages of notes I've taken over the years is impossible to estimate. But it's a lot.\n\nWhen I recently moved offices, I found a couple of old notepads in a drawer. Notes from interviews, articles I had read, etc. And I can tell you: Those were _not_ good notes, in any way. How I take notes has evolved a lot over the years.\n\nBut here it's important to stress that \"how\" is not about the tools I use, going from pen and paper to digital. Rather, \"how\" is about structures, \"note scaffolding\". Type of notes, what details are written down, what is not, etc. The biggest change over the years is how I structure my notes to make them useful not only in the moment but also in the long run.\n\nLooking back and comparing decade-old notes with more recent ones, it becomes obvious that note-taking is a skill. And just like with any other skill, you have to practice to improve.\n\nHow (still the process, not the tool) you take notes depends on the end goal. To me, it's primarily to help in researching and preparing for text to be written. It can be interview questions, articles, reports, white papers, and books. Thinking about what I need and why has eventually led me to a couple of \"note types\" that are the backbone of _my_ \"how\":\n\n1. **Source notes.** A short \"bibliography\", with information on the type of source (book, paper, conference, podcast, etc), author, publish date, etc.\n2. **Highlight notes.** What in a physical book would be marked with a yellow highlight pen. Every highlight relates to a source note.\n3. **Thought notes.** What thoughts or ideas do the highlights spark for me? Write them down, and link them to the highlight.\n4. **Cluster notes.** The first three types are about digesting sources. With my cluster notes, I start to \"build\", putting highlights and thoughts into context. In my cluster notes, I pull in highlights and thoughts from many different sources, combining ideas into a first draft.\n\nThis is my notetaking _process_. One that I've used for years, and that supports me in my goal.\n\nBut the _tool_ where this process is implemented has changed and will change.\n\n## Tinkering leads to craftmanship\n\nAnd this is why I don't think that tinkering with new tools is necessarily procrastination. Rather the opposite. Trying out tools, be it new ones or diving deep into the ones you already use, sharpens your skills and eventually lets the tool fade into the back.\n\nSince going digital for my note-taking, I've switched tools a couple of times. I started with Evernote, and am currently using a combination of Obsidian and Tana. On the way there, I've also used Notational Velocity, nvALT, SublimeText, and The Archive.\n\nEvery change in the tool has been about features that make my current process more frictionless, and hence give me more time _working_ with my notes, spending less time _managing_ them.\n\nAnd I think that's the distinction that's important to make:\n\nSwitching processes is expensive, in both time and energy. No matter if you switch tools or not.\n\nBut changing how you _implement_ an established workflow, be it in the app you already are using or switching to a new one, is less expensive.\n\nWhen I got access to Tana a couple of months ago, I could immediately tell that it was a tool that could support my notetaking process in ways that Obsidian can't.\n\nBut – and here comes the important part – tinkering with Tana _also_ helped me realize how I could push Obsidian to the limits for another important goal with my notetaking, documenting meetings and projects. This has been a pain point for me for a while, not really finding a way to implement my idea on how to make that kind of notes.\n\nHad I _not_ spent time tinkering with Tana had I not figured that part out either.\n\nYou have to practice to become better. And trying out tools – be it features you are not using in your current one or exploring something completely new – is a way to practice.\n\n🛠️\n\n**Scaffolding for notes**  \nI'm currently outlining what will hopefully become a short e-book on my note-taking process and how I've implemented it using Readwise and Tana. \n\nIf that sounds interesting, sign up for my _Scaffolding for notes_ newsletter in the form down below.\n\n### Subscribe to myttl\n\nDon’t miss out on the latest issues.

On the other hand, many economists adopt a more cautious stance, expressing doubt regarding the potential for AI to dramatically increase the rate of change.  1  In this conversation, economist Matt Clancy and research scientist Tamay Besiroglu debate the prospects for a radical rupture with historical rates of economic growth and technological progress.\n\nThis conversation is based on a series of back-and-forths Matt and Tamay had in spring of 2023\\. The opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers.\n\n**Tamay:** Hi, Matt. I’m excited to have this chat.\n\n**Matt:** Likewise!\n\n**Tamay:** Before we delve in, I believe it’s crucial to frame our dialogue by outlining the central themes we’ll be addressing.\n\nThis is a debate about the expected economic impact of artificial intelligence much more advanced than today’s large language models like GPT-4\\. Specifically, I want to discuss the impacts of AI advanced enough to perform most or all tasks currently performed by humans. This includes things like running companies and all the planning and strategic thinking that comes along with that, designing and running scientific experiments, producing and directing movies, conducting novel philosophical inquiry, and much more.\n\nThese systems I have in mind are clearly leaps and bounds more advanced than any systems we have today, so why do I think this is even worth discussing? I think there is compelling work that points to it being very likely (say about 80% likely) that such AI systems that at least match the capacities of humans both in generality and capability will be developed this century.  2 \n\nOur second theme centers on the concept of “explosive growth.” I'm referring to a rate of growth that far surpasses anything we’ve previously witnessed — a minimum of tenfold the annual growth rate observed over the past century, sustained for at least a decade.\n\nI am inclined to believe that such explosive growth is not just a possibility, but a probable outcome when we transition to an era where AI automates the vast majority of tasks currently performed by humans. To put this in numbers, I’d currently assign a 65% chance of this happening. I think you disagree with this view, correct?\n\n**Matt:** That’s right. While I think it’s very likely that growth will pick up once we deploy AI throughout the economy, I think it’s maybe a 10% to 20% chance, depending on how I’m feeling, that economic growth becomes explosive, by your definition, with most of that probability clustered around the low end of explosive growth. \n\n‘Explosive’ is certainly an apt term for what we’re talking about. GDP per capita grew at roughly 2% per year over the 20th century, so if we jump to 20% per year for 10 years, that’s about 90 years of technological progress (at 2% per year) compressed into a decade. Ninety years of progress was enough to go from covered wagons to rocket ships! And your definition also encompasses even faster growth persisting for even longer!\n\nFrankly, I’m not sure our models of economic growth are up to the task of extrapolating that far outside of historical experience. The economy is so complicated that economists have to make a large number of simplifying assumptions. We try to focus on simplifications that aren’t decisive so that greater complexity and realism wouldn’t much change the model’s takeaway. But the more you take a model outside of the context it was designed to explain, the more uncertain you have to be that one of those simplifications might no longer be innocuous.\n\n**Tamay:** In my view, accelerating growth is probably not decoupled from historical experience. Economic growth today is much faster than before the industrial revolution roughly 200 years ago. Moreover, the agrarian societies that emerged from the Neolithic Revolution likely saw much faster economic growth than hunter-gatherer subsistence societies of 10,000 years ago. In this sense, economic acceleration roughly on the order we’re considering for this debate is perhaps actually something of a historical norm.\n\nThere is also precedent for very high _levels_ of growth. In particular, double-digit growth has occurred many times in the context of “catch-up growth” in East Asia in the ’60s and ’70s, notably in China but also in Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea, to name a few. I think this further helps rule out very low priors for growth accelerations.\n\nI think this historical evidence is compelling enough to require one to assess the arguments for expecting about 20% growth rates in gross world product on its merits, rather than supposing that we should ignore this possibility until we have very strong watertight models of the economic effects of AI.\n\n**Matt:** I’m happy to grant that we have seen accelerations of growth on par with what you’re describing, and maybe rare cases of sustained growth that get within sight of the levels you are talking about. But at the same time, I think it’s notable that none of the accelerations we’re talking about or the rapid rates of catch-up growth experienced in the Asian tigers are typically believed to be driven by a sudden influx of intelligence into the economy. Still, I think the fact that growth has accelerated and has in some cases gone into double digits is a good reason to think there is some chance it could happen again.\n\nI agree AI like you’re talking about will be transformative. But we’ve had transformative technologies before without explosive growth.  3  Since the so-called First Industrial Revolution set the economy on its modern growth trajectory, we’ve gone through several subsequent industrial revolutions: electricity, the chemical revolution, and the birth of the computer age. In the end, each of those radically transformed the material world we live in. And yet, if you tried to spot those revolutions by looking at a chart of economic growth, you would be hard pressed to see much of anything: Growth has been remarkably stable at around 2% per year, in the U.S.A., for more than a century.\n\nWhat do you think makes AI different?\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sif7L0gSvlKuUWFrT5drY6LdwCgxQUp6E6zGVDqscUS8/https://asteriskmag.com/media/pages/issues/03/the-great-inflection-a-debate-about-ai-and-explosive-growth/1a600a9e23-1686682917/clancy_besiroglu_banach.webp) \n\n Karol Banach \n\n**Tamay:** Our best models of economic growth seem to support the prediction that if we can develop AI that is a suitable substitute for human labor, the growth rate could potentially increase very substantially, at least for a while.\n\nOne key insight, from the Nobel laureate Paul Romer, is that ideas are important for economic growth and unusual relative to other economic factors, since their availability does not diminish with increased usage. The Python programming language, the chain rule in calculus, or Maxwell’s equations can be used by countless individuals without becoming scarce. Most goods are not like that. For example, if you invest in a new building, the more people who use it, the less space they each have.\n\nThe semi-endogenous model of economic growth, incorporating Romer’s insight, says that there are three important “factors of production,” or inputs, for final goods: capital (machinery, tools, buildings, etc.), labor, and ideas. Theoretically, doubling all your inputs to production should double your output, since you could set up identical copies of existing production processes. But doubling capital and labor also doubles the input of the production of new ideas, as more workers have the resources to do more research. And because each worker and firm can use these new ideas without diminishing the total supply, all of them can become more productive. This results in the total output growing more than proportionally. In other words, this model implies what economists call “increasing returns to scale”: When your inputs double, your output more than doubles.\n\nSemi-endogenous growth theory predicts that economic growth is primarily constrained by population growth — and with a growing population, the economy can grow super-exponentially. A larger population generates more ideas, thereby enhancing productivity. The enhanced productivity then boosts output further, creating a larger economy which can sustain an even larger population, creating a loop of continuously accelerating growth. Although historical economic data can be unreliable, one prevalent interpretation, favored by economist Michael Kremer, aligns with this theory: The human population and the economy have grown in lockstep, resulting in a super-exponential increase in output.\n\nWhen innovations like an agricultural or industrial revolution led to population explosions, growth accelerated. And economic growth has likely been capped on the order of 2% during the 20th century because, due to biological limitations on reproduction, population growth can’t exceed mid-single-digit percentages annually.\n\nThis framework also explains why the invention of electricity, the chemical revolution, or the birth of the computer age didn’t cause accelerating growth: They didn’t perfectly substitute for human labor, and so didn’t fundamentally change how the inputs to production are brought about. But with AI, our population of workers and idea producers could once again grow exponentially. What I take to be our most compelling theory of economic growth — semi-endogenous growth — implies that this will return us to what we might consider the historical trend of accelerating growth.\n\n**Matt:** I think that’s a fair representation of what those economic growth models say. In short, the ultimate driver of economic growth is the discovery and application of new knowledge. Since AI can create ideas, like minds, this feedback loop is possible in a way that it isn’t for other technologies. This is one reason I don’t think explosive growth is simply impossible. At the same time, I’m not sure the dynamic you’re describing, where AI is different because it helps us create new ideas, is actually as different from historical experience as you say.\n\nHere’s a verbal sketch of a model of innovation with AI by economists Philippe Aghion, Benjamin Jones, and Charles Jones that I think does a good job of illustrating just how AI needs to be different from other technologies in order to lead to explosive growth. Suppose there are an enormous number of different tasks that need to be done to invent new technologies — everything from developing new scientific theories and conducting experiments to figuring out how to manufacture and distribute new inventions. Let’s also assume that to invent enough new technologies to deliver 2% annual economic growth, every one of those tasks needs to get done — you can’t skip any. And each task takes a certain amount of time to do. Last, let’s assume innovation gets harder as you go,  4  so that each of those tasks needs 1% more inventor hours every year in order to keep up the same pace of technological progress.\n\nNow for the AI. Let’s assume that technological progress means we steadily figure out how to get machines to do tasks that previously only humans could do. I think there is actually nothing new about that, even for cognitive work. We used to transmit knowledge to each other by meeting face to face; now you can put the knowledge in a book that can automatically communicate it to any reader. We used to calculate statistics with human computers; now we use mechanical ones. AI continues that dynamic. One might think, in this model, that as we figure out how to hand off more and more of the tasks to the machines, growth should steadily accelerate, since machines can be multiplied at a much faster rate than human workers.\n\nBut that’s not actually the case. For example, suppose we figure out how to hand off half the tasks of technological progress to machines. For now, we can assume the humans who used to do these tasks are unemployed, or receive some kind of universal basic income. The machines might be able to complete their half of the tasks at lightning speed but that wouldn’t, on its own, speed up the overall rate of technological progress. That’s because the other half of tasks would take just as long to do as before, and technological progress requires all the tasks to be completed. It’s like a factory assembly line where some workers are really fast and others are slow. If workers are trained to do only their task, and can’t help each other out, then the overall speed of production is bottlenecked on the slowest worker.\n\nThat example isn’t quite right either, though, because workers can be trained to help each other out. In fact, if half the tasks humans do were automated, then we might be able to retrain the workers whose jobs are replaced to focus on tasks only humans can do. With twice the workforce on each of these tasks now, we can get those tasks done in half the time. So, in fact, this simple model implies that if we automate half the tasks, technological progress takes half the time (compared to automating nothing).\n\nIf we make more realistic assumptions about the pace of automation historically, this story shows how advancing automation is consistent with steady exponential growth like we observed over the previous century. Suppose we automate 1% of the tasks each year. That frees up 1% of the labor force, and, with retraining, the tasks we have not yet automated get a 1% larger labor force. But recall I assumed that innovation gets harder, so that each year, each task takes 1% more hours to complete. The two forces balance out, and we end up getting consistent 2% growth.\n\nThat does seem to match the experience of the 20th century. During the 20th century we automated a great deal of stuff that previously only humans could do, and humans had to continually shift the nature of their work. And yet, through that whole period, growth didn’t accelerate.\n\nIn this kind of model, what can deliver explosive growth? There are two routes. Either you greatly speed up the pace of automation, so that you can shift a lot more than 1% of the workforce onto the remaining tasks, or you automate 100% of the tasks necessary for innovation. If machines really can do _everything_, you do get a feedback effect where greater economic growth rapidly improves your ability to discover new technologies.\n\nYou don’t find this argument compelling though. Can you explain where you think it goes awry?\n\n**Tamay:** The usual way we think about economic bottlenecks is as goods or services that are complementary to one another: The outputs from the automated task are more valuable when combined with the outputs of non-automated tasks. For example, an AI that can design new products is much more useful when we can quickly build working prototypes. This means that scaling up “digital workers” could provide limited value if they still could not perform all the tasks humans can.\n\nI think you give the impression that, in this case, “digital workers” would provide very little value. However, I don’t think this is correct. The standard theory of economic production tells us it is hard but not impossible to increase productivity when bottlenecked by human labor. Let’s say we automate 75% of all tasks in the economy. In this case, we might conservatively need to scale up the number of “digital workers” 10 times to match the effect of doubling all human inputs, but the scaling of at least this magnitude is precisely what I expect! Digital workers are just computations on chips, so we can make more of them quickly by channeling more money into producing and improving AI hardware.\n\nTo make your argument work, I think you need to make a few bold — and, to me, implausible-seeming — assumptions. The existence of some bottleneck tasks is not enough. You must show that there are _many_ tasks that AI just cannot automate, say on the order of 25% or more.\n\nSince the output of different tasks complement each other, the value of automation compounds: as more tasks are automated, already-automated tasks become even more valuable, substantially boosting growth. Combined with the growth effect of concentrating your workers in a smaller set of non-automated tasks, AI automation could increase output by one or two orders of magnitude, even if we assume that there are 25% of tasks that AI cannot do.\n\nTherefore, even if we assume that there are quite a few tasks that AI systems cannot do, we will probably still see explosive growth if going from little to substantial AI automation happens on the order of decades. Hence, for the argument to work, you must show that this AI automation will likely be drawn out and take on the order of a century. However, this runs counter to the existing research on the topic, such Tom Davidson’s report, as well as recent evidence from the rapid progress in AI.  5  This evidence suggests, by contrast, that we should expect AI automation not to be drawn out but to be relatively compressed around the middle of this century.\n\nAnother way you could rescue the argument is to suppose that it’s very hard to substitute AI for human labor (notably, more so than I think we have evidence to suppose). However, this likely has the effect of delaying rather than blocking explosive growth. In fact, severe difficulties here could make explosive growth more likely! That’s because — as you say — such difficulties mean that growth will be bottlenecked by the part of the process that’s slowest to improve. But when those final tasks are automated, this same dynamic leads to very substantial sudden spurts in growth as the accumulated productivity that the prior bottlenecks suppressed is unlocked.\n\nWe should also expect investment and the vastly expanded amount of cognitive effort to be specifically aimed at automating bottleneck tasks. Take a specific example: Performing “embodied tasks” might be hard for AI. As a result, the prices of manufacturing goods will remain high, while the prices of automated “knowledge work” might come down, just like how the share of the economy devoted to agriculture plummeted after tasks like plowing and harvesting could be done by machines, while everything else grew. Manufacturing, construction, and similar sectors could see higher relative prices once “knowledge work” is substantially automated. Investors will generally aim at automating tasks that bottleneck economic growth, as these sectors become more relatively valuable and profitable.\n\nWill all this investment in compute and R\u0026D be enough to automate most or all tasks? While this is a very difficult question for which we only have fairly weak evidence, relevant work suggests that the amount of additional computation required for full automation is, in some sense, not all that large: Scaling computation by only half as much as we’ve seen in the past 50 years could very well be sufficient. Overall, this leaves me with the mainline expectation of the development of advanced AI involving accelerating automation until full automation.\n\n**Matt:** Got it. Let me respond to your rebuttals.\n\nFirst, your arguments suggest that even if artificial general intelligence can’t do everything, we can still get a temporary bout of explosive growth — maybe lasting decades — before human bottlenecks come back to bite us. That happens because extra intelligence applied to automated tasks isn’t negligible even in the absence of full automation; it vastly increases economic output and frees up a bunch of labor to work on the “human-essential” tasks. Sure, it eventually hits diminishing returns, so maybe you need many more digital workers than you would need humans to double production, but digital workers will probably be plentiful. \n\nI think our historical experience of automation is evidence against that. We’ve been automating parts of the economy for a long time now: Dockworkers used to manually unload ships, and that’s now done much more often by automation; assembly line workers are often replaced by industrial robots; human computers used to do the work of silicon ones. In principle, you can build as many machines as you want, and so one could argue that the number of effective workers in those automated sectors exploded, or could have exploded. And humans, freed from the need to work the docks, stand in assembly lines, or calculate by pen and pencil, can focus on the non-automated remaining jobs. And they did! But economic growth remained steady. So I’m not sure why it should be so different when it is cognitive work that is being handed off to the machines.\n\nSecond, you’re also saying that as automation proceeds, it will get more and more profitable to figure out how to automate the remnants that depend on expensive human labor. That will lead to more effort to automate these bottleneck sectors. I agree that will be the case; lots of economic studies document that R\u0026D responds to these kinds of opportunities. But again — hasn’t this always been the case? The U.S. economy is a lot bigger today than at the beginning of the 20th century, and machines can do a lot more of the jobs we used to have to do ourselves, freeing up a lot of brainpower. Meanwhile, the incentive to automate surely has gone up, as wages rise and the consumers are richer than ever. And in fact, we do spend a lot more on R\u0026D! But the increased effort at automating the rest of the economy hasn’t led to an uptick in growth. That suggests to me your model is missing something important.\n\nFor explosive growth to happen, we need a break from that historical experience of steadily advancing automation. Either the rate at which we automate the tasks humans do needs to accelerate or we need to actually automate _everything_ so the pesky human bottlenecks don’t matter anymore. If, instead, we end up in a world where AGI slowly and steadily takes over more and more tasks, then we remain always stuck in the kind of world we’ve been in for the last century, with steady exponential growth.\n\n**Tamay:** I agree that explosive growth most likely requires accelerating or full automation. It’s a good question: Why did past automation not noticeably accelerate growth, as I expect will likely happen with AI? \n\nIn the past, automation mostly took the form of technologies that automate small segments of production, offering modest benefits while requiring numerous expensive synchronized changes across the economy to be implemented. In contrast, if AI is capable of everything a human can do, we could potentially automate large numbers of tasks in one go, with fewer costly updates to existing processes.\n\nIn the past, automation was largely the product of human ingenuity: Engineers designed better machines and reorganized factories in new ways to ensure these machines complemented existing processes. But scaling the compute used to train AI models can meaningfully substitute for human ingenuity.\n\nIn contrast to labor, compute increases proportionally with investment. This means that the inputs that fuel automation can be expanded much more rapidly and efficiently.  6  While engineering and tinkering are still useful for AI automation, simply adding compute can produce models that perform very well at a wide variety of tasks straight out of the box. \n\nTo really appreciate the force of this argument, it is important to recognize just how incredibly fast the stock of AI-relevant compute can expand. In the past decade, the amount of computation used to train AI systems has doubled every six months, increasing by roughly _100-million-fold_ over this period.  7  This is a key reason to expect AI automation to happen in a short time span — given compute trends, we will likely have enough compute to automate 90% of tasks no more than a few decades after we will have enough compute to automate the first 20%. \n\nEven though full automation is not necessary for explosive growth, it just seems very likely to happen. It is, of course, a coherent possibility that we will come up with a new task for humans each time we automate one, so that, like Zeno’s tortoise, humans will stay ahead in the race between us and machine. However, I think there are no good reasons to believe that when AI systems can perform almost all the tasks humans can do, there will be some convenient gap that humans can snugly fit into, and that, even with million-fold more computation, these tasks will remain impervious to AI-automation.\n\nGiven that you attribute only a 10% likelihood to explosive growth, it appears you consider both accelerating automation and full automation from AI highly improbable. I'd be interested to learn the underlying rationale that gives you such confidence in this perspective.\n\n**Matt**: As a quick aside, note that the 100-million-fold increase in computing power dedicated to AI over the last decade has not led to an acceleration in economic growth so far. That said, I do think AI is pretty likely to boost growth, for many of the reasons you articulate. But my best guess at why we won’t see changes as dramatic as you anticipate is because there are going to be a billion little bottlenecks that will persistently slow the rate at which AGI takes over tasks.\n\nLet me give you some examples. This is going to be a long list, so I won’t go into much detail on any particular item. Even so, I suspect there are many other issues that I am failing to imagine, precisely because it is hard to see the details that matter unless you are in the weeds.\n\nTo start, most tasks today require the ability to do stuff in the physical world. We can assume we’ll develop robots that can do that work, but that’s not a given. In other sectors, the issue might be supply of crucial raw materials (rare earth metals?), without which all the brain and muscle power in the world is useless. Elsewhere, the scarce resource might be suitable training data. The economy is full of jobs that can’t be easily codified into data accessible to a machine. Assuming our AGI has a robot body and full cooperation from the humans (neither guaranteed), it may need to learn a job at the same pace as a human apprentice (since that’s how fast data is generated). \n\nTime could be a binding constraint in a lot of other ways as well. In agriculture, it just takes a certain amount of time for the plants to grow. In entertainment, there are only so many hours in the day to watch movies and TV, read books, or play video games. Research itself also takes time beyond just the time to think — it tends to be an iterative process, where you theorize and plan, then test your ideas against reality. Those tests involve waiting for natural processes to play out: diseases to progress, social interventions to take effect, rockets to be built and launched (and blown up), and so on.\n\nThere are still other sectors where humanity (not merely intelligence) is seen as a crucial part of the value provided. Today we can watch or listen to the best performances ever recorded, but people still go to live concerts, plays, and sports. All else equal, in-person education seems to be preferred by a large number of people, despite the many conveniences of remote education. People could also insist that humans remain the ultimate decision-makers in politics and the legal system.\n\nElsewhere, the issues may be regulatory. If you want to sell cars, you’ll usually need to go through a dealer. If you want to build new buildings and infrastructure, typically you’ll need planning permission and to conduct environmental impact assessments. If you want to release new drugs, you need to run clinical trials to get approval from the FDA. If you want to fly autonomous vehicles, you need to get clearance from the FAA. If you want to provide services in the medical, legal, accounting, engineering, architectural, plumbing, cosmetology, and other licensed professions, you need a license. Then there is likely future regulation on AGI itself, which is a whole can of worms that I won’t get into.\n\nI bet we will eventually update our existing regulations to better suit a world with AGI. But it will take time. And a lot of that updating has to proceed through the slow and messy world of democratic policymaking. \n\nFinally, there is a whole set of activities for which intelligence is deployed in a zero-sum game that doesn’t push forward overall progress. Much of politics has this character and it’s not clear AGI will do anything more here than create a massive arms race between opposing parties and special interest groups. And there are other parts of the economy with elements of this style of zero-sum competition. Imagine an AGI arms race between advertisers for rival products. Or between corporate giants fighting over the patents of the innovations their AGI dreams up.\n\nTo sum up, one scenario I can imagine is that many of the bottlenecks above (and many more I don’t have the institutional knowledge to imagine) are steadily overcome, but at a pace slower than anticipated by AGI optimists today. Then, by the time we clear out these bottlenecks, the parts of the economy where extra cognitive resources are least helpful for driving forward growth — perhaps zero-sum sectors, those best protected by entrenched interest groups, or those where time and humanity are key constraints — may have grown to occupy a large share of the economy, slowing the maximum possible contribution of AI to growth. Another scenario, just as likely, is that solutions to old problems will lead to new ones. That’s how it usually is.\n\nI’m sure that’s a frustrating response to reply to, but at a high level, what do you think of my argument that a lot of annoying details will slow the impact of AGI enough to keep explosive growth perpetually out of reach?\n\n**Tamay:** I agree that reality is messy, and many of these details might end up mattering in important ways. I’ll focus on the considerations that I find most compelling.\n\nMight regulation impede the development and deployment of AI sufficiently to keep growth rates close to historical rates? I think that this is plausible, but I’m not confident it will.\n\nThe costs of training AI systems are dropping precipitously. Current estimates indicate that the costs involved in training machine learning models fall by roughly 60% every year. This means that training runs that currently only the largest technology companies could do will be accessible to most hobbyists in only 10 years’ time. Effective restrictions will therefore very quickly require surveillance at a potentially unprecedented scale.\n\nIt is likely that, as you point out, AI systems will be precluded by regulation from providing various services, such as practicing law or medicine, among many other things. Regulation has arguably slowed down many futuristic technologies, such as nuclear energy, human genetic manipulation, and gene drives.\n\nHowever, I’m not sure this provides much evidence for our ability to stem the tide with respect to AI. The potential value of AI deployment could be immense, with the prospect of increasing output by many orders of magnitude. I think the growth implications are therefore truly formidable, creating powerful incentives for eliminating or bypassing any existing constraints. I think this might be quite unprecedented relative to most other technologies that regulatory constraints were able to suppress in the past. \n\nMoreover, advanced AI could — and this is of course very unfortunate — potentially undermine the democratic process. As AI systems become capable of performing cognitive tasks at significantly lower costs, human labor may lose most, if not almost all, of its value. AI could enable the automation of protest suppression, while valuable assets like data centers can be located away from urban centers, reducing the risk of industrial sabotage. This suggests that beneficiaries of AI-driven growth could eventually play a major role in shaping regulations.\n\nI think the bottom line on regulation is just that there are many unknowns and it’s difficult to be confident one way or another.\n\nSecondly, let’s consider time-related bottlenecks. I agree that many important economic and R\u0026D tasks require feedback from processes that typically play out over a long time. Now, imagine a world where advanced AI technology has enabled us to put 1,000 times more cognitive effort into R\u0026D.  8  Would we still expect processes like testing new nuclear fusion reactors or drugs to take the same amount of time to yield useful feedback? I believe there's a strong chance that such delays could be significantly reduced. \n\nMany tasks that currently take months or years can be parallelized to reduce the amount of serial time involved. Rather than launching one rocket design, observing it blow up, going back to the drawing board, and launching the next design the following year, tens or hundreds of rockets could be launched basically simultaneously. While this approach doesn't allow for continuous refinement of each experiment, there's often a certain number of parallel experiments that can provide the same value of information as a set of sequential ones. This might be wasteful, but remember, we’re supposing that we might get bottlenecked by these types of experiments, so we are willing to spend a larger fraction of a larger amount of output on expediting this process.\n\nFurthermore, I am quite confident that significant improvements can be made in current experimental design. Experiments usually aren’t optimally designed for maximizing the value of information. In a world where a thousandfold increase in R\u0026D effort is also constrained by the serial time required for experiments, we will likely run much more well-crafted and informative experiments.\n\nAdditionally, in the future I'm picturing, AI systems could potentially lessen the need for certain experiments. Take drug trials, for instance. It seems plausible that AI systems could more effectively digest the results of all relevant prior experiments, use specialized AI systems for drug toxicity prediction for safety evaluations, and so on. In many hard-tech domains, like the design of cars, rockets, and semiconductor chips, it seems plausible that high-fidelity physics simulations could reduce the need for some, if not many, key experiments. Combining the results of AI-generated evidence to inform AI-designed highly parallel experiments will probably mean that we will use limited serial time manifold more effectively.\n\nI remain unconvinced by the arguments of specific resource bottlenecks that people often bring up. To convincingly argue that a resource could significantly limit rapid economic growth, one would need to demonstrate that A) the resource is vital for the economy, B) it is extremely challenging to find a substitute for it, even with significantly advanced technology, and C) the resource is so scarce that, even with formidable efforts, we cannot increase its supply by, say, an order of magnitude.\n\nWhile I don't possess the expertise to determine if rare earth metals specifically meet these criteria, without further evidence supporting these points, I regard such arguments as weak.\n\n**Matt:** Let me make three broad observations about your rebuttals before wrapping up.\n\nFirst, I don’t think each of these bottlenecks is enough, on its own, to short-circuit explosive growth. It’s their accumulation. Access to specific materials won’t matter in all sectors, but it might in some. In others it’s time; in others data; in others regulation; and so on. Indeed, I don’t doubt there will also be some sectors where nothing much gets in the way of AI automation. Those sectors may well experience explosive progress, but in a big economy, if human demand for the service doesn’t expand dramatically, the most likely outcome is those parts of the economy become cheap and no longer count for much of GDP.\n\nSecond, a lot of the rebuttals strike me as pretty speculative. Can advanced AI learn a lot from parallel experiments? Can it find massive efficiencies in how we design experiments? Can it skip experiments by running sufficiently detailed simulations? Will economic benefits of AI be strong enough to incentivize regulatory reforms? Will AI disempower labor in a way that upends the political voice of the masses?\n\nWe just don’t know. There is a path through all these unknowns that leads to explosive growth, but I suspect that’s not where most paths lead.\n\nThird, some of the arguments on regulation themselves hinge on the notion that AI will be very powerful, and then layering on top of that some additional theories about how that will affect our politics. If AI turns out to not be as powerful as you think — for example, because it turns out to be harder than you think to efficiently gather data or one of the other bottlenecks described above turns out to be hard to crack — then that will undermine the conditions necessary for those theories about the political effects of AI to be applicable.\n\nOne final meta point. To return to some of my opening remarks, I am nervous about relying heavily on economic models to project a break with historical experience, as I don’t think the models are up to the job of making strong quantitative forecasts outside the range of historical experience. I think they point to faster economic growth, all else equal, and that’s my forecast for the effects of advanced AI too; but that’s about as far as I would take them. \n\nAnother way to put this is: I just don’t think the tools of pure reason — in this case, mathematical models of the economy, in concert with only somewhat applicable historical data — are sufficiently powerful to reveal deep truths about situations where we have a paucity of data and experience. The world is too full of surprises. And I think that skepticism about the tools of pure reason also underlies my skepticism about the transformative power of artificial intelligence itself. If intelligence is powerful enough to accurately forecast far out of sample, into a world transformed by a novel technology, then a technology wielding vastly more intelligence will have a powerful tool at its disposal to remake the world. But if intelligence is too weak a light to see very far, then a technology wielding it may find its global impact slower and smaller than some AI optimists and pessimists believe.\n\n**Tamay:** Numerous plausible obstacles could potentially hinder the course toward explosive growth. There are also other considerations that we haven't delved into, such as delays in investment or issues related to AI misalignment.\n\nIn light of this, extreme confidence in explosive growth happening even conditional on advanced AI being developed seems unwarranted. On the other hand, it seems that confidence in explosive growth not happening also seems misguided given the base rates implied by economic history, the predictions of multiple economic models, our understanding of the pace at which AI could facilitate extensive automation, and a lack of devastating counterarguments. Given what I mentioned, I believe that placing the likelihood of explosive growth — conditional on AGI — somewhere between 25% and 75% strikes a balance between this conflicting evidence.\n\nLastly, I am grateful for joining me in this deep-dive discussion. I admire your work, and your time and insights are truly appreciated!\n\n**Matt:** Same to you! This has been great. In fact, I propose we meet back once GDP per capita has tripled, whether that takes a few years or a few decades, to discuss what we got right and wrong.\n\n1. For example, in a recent survey of economic experts, only 20% believed AI developed in the next 10 years would have a larger impact on growth than the internet, while 61% were uncertain.  ↩\n2.

Really Simple Syndication, or Rich Site Summary—what the acronym stands for depends on who you ask—is a standard that websites and podcasts can use to offer a feed of content to their users, one easily understood by lots of different computer programs. Today, though RSS continues to power many applications on the web, it has become, for most people, an obscure technology.\n\nThe story of how this happened is really two stories. The first is a story about a broad vision for the web’s future that never quite came to fruition. The second is a story about how a collaborative effort to improve a popular standard devolved into one of the most contentious forks in the history of open-source software development.\n\nIn the late 1990s, in the go-go years between Netscape’s IPO and the Dot-com crash, everyone could see that the web was going to be an even bigger deal than it already was, even if they didn’t know exactly how it was going to get there. One theory was that the web was about to be revolutionized by syndication. The web, originally built to enable a simple transaction between two parties—a client fetching a document from a single host server—would be broken open by new standards that could be used to repackage and redistribute entire websites through a variety of channels. Kevin Werbach, [writing for _Release 1.0_](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/r1/07-99.pdf), a newsletter influential among investors in the 1990s, predicted that syndication “would evolve into the core model for the Internet economy, allowing businesses and individuals to retain control over their online personae while enjoying the benefits of massive scale and scope.”\n\n\u003e The future once looked so bright for RSS. What happened?\n\nHe invited his readers to imagine a future in which fencing aficionados, rather than going directly to an “online sporting goods site” or “fencing equipment retailer,” could buy a new épée directly through e-commerce widgets embedded into their favorite website about fencing. Just like in the television world, where big networks syndicate their shows to smaller local stations, syndication on the web would allow businesses and publications to reach consumers through a multitude of intermediary sites. This would mean, as a corollary, that consumers would gain significant control over where and how they interacted with any given business or publication on the web.\n\nRSS was one of the standards that promised to deliver this syndicated future. To Werbach, RSS was “the leading example of a lightweight syndication protocol.” [Another contemporaneous article](https://people.apache.org/~jim/NewArchitect/webrevu/1999/10%5F29/webauthors/10%5F29%5F99%5F2a.html) called RSS the first protocol to realize the potential of Extensible Markup Language (XML), a general-purpose markup language similar to HTML that had recently been developed. It was going to be a way for both users and content aggregators to create their own customized channels out of everything the web had to offer. And yet, two decades later, after the rise of social media and Google’s decision to shut down Google Reader, RSS [appears to be a slowly dying technology](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all\u0026geo=US\u0026q=rss), now used chiefly by podcasters, programmers with tech blogs, and the occasional journalist. Though of course some people really do still rely on RSS readers, stubbornly adding an RSS feed to your blog, even in 2019, is a political statement. That little tangerine bubble has become a wistful symbol of defiance against a centralized web increasingly controlled by a handful of corporations, a web that hardly resembles the syndicated web of Werbach’s imagining.\n\nThe future once looked so bright for RSS. What happened? Was its downfall inevitable, or was it precipitated by the bitter infighting that thwarted the development of a single RSS standard?\n\n## Muddied Water\n\nRSS was invented twice. This meant it never had an obvious owner, a state of affairs that spawned endless debate and acrimony. But it also suggests that RSS was an important idea whose time had come.\n\nIn 1998, Netscape was struggling to envision a future for itself. Its flagship product, the Netscape Navigator web browser—once preferred by [over 80 percent](http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/browserwars.html) of web users—was quickly losing ground to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. So Netscape decided to compete in a new arena. In May, a team was brought together to start work on what was known internally, according to [_Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom_](https://books.google.com/books?id=kwJVAgAAQBAJ\u0026lpg=PA1\u0026pg=PT21#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false) by Ben Hammersley, as “Project 60.” Two months later, Netscape announced “My Netscape,” a web portal that would fight it out with other portals like Yahoo, MSN, and [Excite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excite).\n\nThe following year, in March, Netscape announced an addition to the My Netscape portal called the “My Netscape Network.” My Netscape users could now customize their My Netscape page so that it contained “channels” featuring the most recent headlines from sites around the web. As long as your favorite website published a special file in a format dictated by Netscape, you could add that website to your My Netscape page, typically by clicking an “Add Channel” button that participating websites were supposed to add to their interfaces. A little box containing a list of linked headlines would then appear.\n\n![A My Netscape Network Channel](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/434x254,sZ0xF7F_bnhioZd4DS_HFTeYZnaUSw6uyhcIFu2fNJxg/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/l73zMrIsmXPyru7H_G_AEyExtWQ3SbjVfC42WLSEs0jaRIgyvG62O1XTz6Ij-offY50uQoml6WO97MKCocffameDR7_tggIFXqaRe1-fNeQ37gqV8vhaa__GvwwjIEi9nF59_h-1)\n\nThe special file that participating websites had to publish was an RSS file. In the [My Netscape Network announcement](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-0-9-0), Netscape explained that RSS stood for “RDF Site Summary.” This was somewhat of a misnomer. RDF, or the Resource Description Framework, is basically a grammar for describing certain properties of arbitrary resources. (See [my article about the Semantic Web](https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html) if that sounds really exciting to you.) In 1999, a draft specification for RDF was being considered by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the web’s main standards body. Though RSS was supposed to be based on RDF, the example RSS document Netscape actually released didn’t use any RDF tags at all. In a document that accompanied the Netscape RSS specification, Dan Libby, one of the specification’s authors, [explained](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/rss-dev/conversations/topics/239) that “in this release of MNN, Netscape has intentionally limited the complexity of the RSS format.” The specification was given the 0.90 version number, the idea being that subsequent versions would bring RSS more in line with the W3C’s XML specification and the evolving draft of the RDF specification.\n\nRSS had been created by Libby and two other Netscape employees, Eckart Walther and Ramanathan Guha. According to an email to me from Guha, he and Walther cooked up RSS in the beginning with some input from Libby; after AOL bought Netscape in 1998, he and Walther left and it became Libby’s responsibility. Guha had made major contributions to the development of RDF and he and Walther intended RSS to be an application of the format. But Libby [later wrote](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/rss-dev/conversations/topics/239) that the original vision for an RDF-based RSS was pared back because of time constraints and the perception that RDF was “‘too complex’ for the ‘average user.’”\n\nWhile Netscape was trying to win eyeballs in what became known as the “[portal wars](http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9910/04/portal.war.idg/index.html),” elsewhere on the web a new phenomenon known as “weblogging” was being pioneered. One of these pioneers was Dave Winer, CEO of a company called UserLand Software, which developed early content management systems that made blogging accessible to people without deep technical fluency. Winer ran his own blog, [Scripting News](http://scripting.com/), which today is one of the oldest blogs on the internet. More than a year before Netscape announced My Netscape Network, on December 15, 1997, Winer [published a post](http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html) announcing that the blog would now be available in XML as well as HTML.\n\nDave Winer’s XML format became known as the Scripting News format. It was [supposedly similar](http://xent.com/FoRK-archive/sept00/0211.html) to Microsoft’s Channel Definition Format (a “push technology” standard submitted to the W3C in March, 1997), but I haven’t been able to find a file in the original format to verify that claim. Like Netscape’s RSS, it structured the content of Winer’s blog so that it could be understood by other software applications. When Netscape released RSS 0.90, Winer and UserLand Software began to support both formats. But Winer believed that Netscape’s format was “woefully inadequate” and “[missing the key thing web writers and readers need](http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/06/16/aFaceOffWithNetscape.html).” It could only represent a list of links, whereas the Scripting News format could represent a series of paragraphs, each containing one or more links.\n\nIn June 1999, two months after Netscape’s My Netscape Network announcement, Winer introduced a new version of the Scripting News format, called ScriptingNews 2.0b1\\. Winer claimed that he decided to move ahead with his own format only after trying but failing to get anyone at Netscape to care about RSS 0.90’s deficiencies. The new version of the Scripting News format added several items to the element that brought the Scripting News format to parity with RSS. But the two formats continued to differ in that the Scripting News format, which Winer nicknamed the “fat” syndication format, could include entire paragraphs and not just links.\n\nNetscape got around to releasing RSS 0.91 the very next month. The updated specification was a major about-face. RSS no longer stood for “RDF Site Summary”; it now stood for “Rich Site Summary.” All the RDF—and there was almost none anyway—was stripped out. Many of the Scripting News tags were incorporated. In the text of the new specification, [Libby explained](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-0-9-1-netscape):\n\n\u003e RDF references removed. RSS was originally conceived as a metadata format providing a summary of a website. Two things have become clear: the first is that providers want more of a syndication format than a metadata format. The structure of an RDF file is very precise and must conform to the RDF data model in order to be valid. This is not easily human-understandable and can make it difficult to create useful RDF files. The second is that few tools are available for RDF generation, validation and processing. For these reasons, we have decided to go with a standard XML approach.\n\nWiner was enormously pleased with RSS 0.91, [calling it](http://scripting.com/1999/07/28.html) “even better than I thought it would be.” UserLand Software adopted it as a replacement for the existing ScriptingNews 2.0b1 format. For a while, it seemed that RSS finally had a single authoritative specification.\n\n## The Great Fork\n\nA year later, the RSS 0.91 specification had become woefully inadequate. There were all sorts of things people were trying to do with RSS that the specification did not address. There were other parts of the specification that seemed unnecessarily constraining—each RSS channel could only contain a maximum of 15 items or links, for example.\n\nBy that point, RSS had been adopted by several more organizations. Other than Netscape, which seems to have lost interest after RSS 0.91, the big players were Dave Winer’s UserLand Software; O’Reilly Net, which ran an RSS aggregator called Meerkat; and Moreover.com, which also ran an RSS aggregator focused on news. Via mailing list, representatives from these organizations and others regularly discussed how to improve on RSS 0.91\\. But there were deep disagreements about what those improvements should look like.\n\n\u003e At the root of this disagreement about namespaces was a deeper disagreement about what RSS was even for.\n\nThe mailing list in which most of the discussion occurred was called the Syndication mailing list. [An archive of the Syndication mailing list](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/syndication/info) is still available. It is an amazing historical resource. It provides a moment-by-moment account of how those deep disagreements eventually led to a political rupture of the RSS community.\n\nOn one side of the coming rupture was Winer. Winer was impatient to evolve RSS, but he wanted to change it only in relatively conservative ways. In June, 2000, he published his own RSS 0.91 specification on the UserLand website, meant to be a starting point for further development of RSS. It made no significant changes to the 0.91 specification published by Netscape. Winer [claimed in a blog post](http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/backissues/2000/06/07/#rss) that accompanied his specification that it was only a “cleanup” documenting how RSS was actually being used in the wild, which was needed because the Netscape specification was no longer being maintained. In the same post, he argued that RSS had succeeded so far because it was simple, and that some of the changes being proposed in the Syndication mailing list would only make RSS “vastly more complex, and IMHO, at the content provider level, would buy us almost nothing for the added complexity.” He was especially set against any plan that would add namespaces to RSS or reintroduce the RDF formalisms that had been dropped before the release of RSS 0.91\\. (Namespaces would basically allow programmers to define sub-formats of RSS, meaning that cool new functionality could be added to RSS without everyone agreeing on every detail. But namespaces would make writing software to read RSS more challenging.) In a message to the Syndication mailing list sent around the same time, [Winer suggested](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/syndication/conversations/topics/132) that these issues were important enough that they might lead him to create a fork:\n\n\u003e I’m still pondering how to move RSS forward. I definitely want ICE-like stuff in RSS2, publish and subscribe is at the top of my list, but I am going to fight tooth and nail for simplicity. I love optional elements. I don’t want to go down the namespaces and schema road, or try to make it a dialect of RDF. I understand other people want to do this, and therefore I guess we’re going to get a fork. I have my own opinion about where the other fork will lead, but I’ll keep those to myself for the moment at least.\n\nArrayed against Winer were several other people, including Rael Dornfest of O’Reilly, Ian Davis (responsible for a search startup called Calaba), and a precocious, 14-year-old Aaron Swartz. This is the same Aaron Swartz that would later co-found Reddit and become famous for his hacktivism; in 2000, according to an email to me from Davis, his dad often accompanied him to technology meetups. Dornfest, Davis, and Swartz all thought that RSS needed namespaces in order to accommodate the many different things everyone wanted to do with it. On another mailing list hosted by O’Reilly, [Davis proposed](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/07/05/deviant/rss.html) a namespace-based module system, writing that such a system would “make RSS as extensible as we like rather than packing in new features that over-complicate the spec.” The “namespace camp” believed that RSS would soon be used for much more than the syndication of blog posts, so namespaces, rather than being a complication, were the only way to keep RSS from becoming unmanageable as it supported more and more use cases.\n\nAt the root of this disagreement about namespaces was a deeper disagreement about what RSS was even for. Winer had invented his Scripting News format to syndicate the posts he wrote for his blog. Netscape had released RSS as “RDF Site Summary” because it was a way of recreating a site in miniature within the My Netscape online portal. Some people felt that Netscape’s original vision should be honored. Writing to the Syndication mailing list, Davis [explained his view](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/syndication/conversations/topics/188) that RSS was “originally conceived as a way of building mini sitemaps,” and that now he and others wanted to expand RSS “to encompass more types of information than simple news headlines and to cater for the new uses of RSS that have emerged over the last 12 months.” This overstates the degree to which there was a unified vision at Netscape; Libby, in an email to me, said that there was contention between a “Let’s Build the Semantic Web” group and “Let’s Make This Simple for People to Author” group even during the development of RSS. In a reply to Davis’s post, Winer argued for another origin story entirely: He claimed that his Scripting News format was in fact the first RSS and that it had been meant for a very different purpose. Given that the people most involved in the development of RSS disagreed about who had created RSS and why, a fork seems to have been inevitable.\n\nThe fork happened after Dornfest announced a proposed RSS 1.0 specification and formed the RSS-DEV Working Group—which would include Davis, Swartz, and several others but not Winer—to get it ready for publication. In the proposed specification, RSS once again stood for “RDF Site Summary,” because RDF had been added back in to represent metadata properties of certain RSS elements. The specification acknowledged Winer by name, giving him credit for popularizing RSS through his “[evangelism.](http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/spec)” But it also argued that RSS could not be improved in the way that Winer was advocating. Just adding more elements to RSS without providing for extensibility with a module system would ”sacrifice scalability.” The specification went on to define a module system for RSS based on XML namespaces.\n\nWiner felt that it was “[unfair](http://www.diveintomark.link/2002/history-of-the-rss-fork)” that the RSS-DEV Working Group had arrogated the “RSS 1.0” name for themselves. In another mailing list about decentralization, he wrote that he had “[recently had a standard stolen by a big name](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/decentralization/conversations/topics/326),” presumably meaning O’Reilly, which had convened the RSS-DEV Working Group. Other members of the Syndication mailing list also felt that the RSS-DEV Working Group should not have used the name “RSS” without unanimous agreement from the community on how to move RSS forward. But the Working Group stuck with the name. Dan Brickley, another member of the RSS-DEV Working Group, defended this decision by [arguing](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/rss-dev/conversations/topics/1136) that “RSS 1.0 as proposed is solidly grounded in the original RSS vision, which itself had a long heritage going back to MCF (an RDF precursor) and related specs (CDF etc).” He essentially felt that the RSS 1.0 effort had a better claim to the RSS name than Winer did, since RDF had originally been a part of RSS. The RSS-DEV Working Group published a final version of their specification in December. That same month, Winer published his own improvement to RSS 0.91, which he called RSS 0.92, on UserLand’s website. RSS 0.92 made several small optional improvements to RSS, among which was the addition of the tag soon used by podcasters everywhere. RSS had officially forked.\n\nThe fork might have been avoided if a better effort had been made to include Winer in the RSS-DEV Working Group. He obviously belonged there; he was a prominent contributor to the Syndication mailing list and responsible for much of RSS’ popularity, as the members of the Working Group themselves acknowledged. But, as Davis wrote in an email to me, Winer “wanted control and wanted RSS to be his legacy so was reluctant to work with us.” Winer supposedly refused to participate. Tim O’Reilly, founder and CEO of O’Reilly, [explained](http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg021537.html) this in a UserLand discussion group in September, 2000:\n\n\u003e A group of people involved in RSS got together to start thinking about its future evolution. Dave was part of the group. When the consensus of the group turned in a direction he didn’t like, Dave stopped participating, and characterized it as a plot by O’Reilly to take over RSS from him, despite the fact that Rael Dornfest of O’Reilly was only one of about a dozen authors of the proposed RSS 1.0 spec, and that many of those who were part of its development had at least as long a history with RSS as Dave had.\n\n[Winer responded](http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg021560.html) to Tim O’Reilly by writing the following:\n\n\u003e I met with Dale \\[Dougherty\\] two weeks before the announcement, and he didn’t say anything about it being called RSS 1.0\\. I spoke on the phone with Rael the Friday before it was announced, again he didn’t say that they were calling it RSS 1.0\\. The first I found out about it was when it was publicly announced.\n\n\u003e Let me ask you a straight question. If it turns out that the plan to call the new spec “RSS 1.0” was done in private, without any heads-up or consultation, or for a chance for the Syndication list members to agree or disagree, not just me, what are you going to do?\n\n\u003e UserLand did a lot of work to create and popularize and support RSS. We walked away from that, and let your guys have the name. That’s the top level. If I want to do any further work in Web syndication, I have to use a different name. Why and how did that happen Tim?\n\nI have not been able to find a discussion in the Syndication mailing list about using the RSS 1.0 name prior to the announcement of the RSS 1.0 proposal. Winer, in a message to me, said that he was not trying to control RSS and just wanted to use it in his products.\n\nRSS would fork again in 2003, when several developers frustrated with the bickering in the RSS community sought to create an entirely new format. These developers created Atom, a format that did away with RDF but embraced XML namespaces. Atom would eventually be specified by [a standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force, the organization responsible for establishing and promoting the internet’s rules of the road. After the introduction of Atom, there were three competing versions of RSS: Winer’s RSS 0.92 (updated to RSS 2.0 in 2002 and renamed “Really Simple Syndication”), the RSS-DEV Working Group’s RSS 1.0, and Atom. Today we mostly use RSS 2.0 and Atom.\n\n## Retreat\n\nThe proliferation of competing RSS specifications may have hampered RSS in other ways that I’ll discuss shortly. But it did not stop RSS from becoming enormously popular during the 2000s. By 2004, the [_New York Times_](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/) had started offering its headlines in RSS and had written an article explaining to the layperson what RSS was and how to use it. Google Reader, the RSS aggregator ultimately used by millions, was launched in 2005\\. By 2013, RSS seemed popular enough that the _New York Times_, [in its obituary for Aaron Swartz](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html), called the technology “ubiquitous.” For a while, before a third of the planet had signed up for Facebook, RSS was simply how many people stayed abreast of news on the internet.\n\n\u003e Unfortunately, syndication on the modern web still only happens through one of a very small number of channels, meaning that none of us “retain control over our online personae” the way that Werbach imagined we would.\n\nThe _New York Times_ published Swartz’ obituary in January 2013\\. By that point, though, RSS had actually turned a corner and was well on its way to becoming an obscure technology. Google Reader was [shut down](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html) in July 2013, ostensibly because user numbers had been falling “over the years.” This prompted several articles from various outlets declaring that RSS was dead. But people had been declaring that RSS was dead for years, even before Google Reader’s shuttering. Steve Gillmor, [writing for TechCrunch in May](https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/) 2009, advised that “it’s time to get completely off RSS and switch to Twitter” because “RSS just doesn’t cut it anymore.” He pointed out that Twitter was basically a better RSS feed, since it could show you what people thought about an article in addition to the article itself. It allowed you to follow people and not just channels. Gillmor told his readers that it was time to let RSS recede into the background. He ended his article with a verse from Bob Dylan’s “Forever Young.”\n\nToday, RSS is not dead. But neither is it anywhere near as popular as it once was. Lots of people have offered explanations for why RSS lost its broad appeal. Perhaps the most persuasive explanation is exactly the one offered by Gillmor in 2009\\. Social networks, just like RSS, provide a feed featuring all the latest news on the internet. Social networks took over from RSS because they were simply better feeds. They also provide more benefits to the companies that own them. Some people have accused Google, for example, of shutting down Google Reader in order to encourage people to use Google+. Google might have been able to monetize Google+ in a way that it could never have monetized Google Reader. Marco Arment, the creator of Instapaper, [wrote on his blog in 2013](https://marco.org/2013/07/03/lockdown):\n\n\u003e Google Reader is just the latest casualty of the war that Facebook started, seemingly accidentally: the battle to own everything. While Google did technically “own” Reader and could make some use of the huge amount of news and attention data flowing through it, it conflicted with their far more important Google+ strategy: they need everyone reading and sharing everything through Google+ so they can compete with Facebook for ad-targeting data, ad dollars, growth, and relevance.\n\nSo both users and technology companies realized that they got more out of using social networks than they did out of RSS.\n\nAnother theory is that RSS was always too geeky for regular people. Even the _New York Times_, which seems to have been eager to adopt RSS and promote it to its audience, [complained in 2006](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/travel/theres-a-popular-new-code-for-deals-rss.html?mtrref=twobithistory.org\u0026gwh=67FB5C9803C65996280A9D3C1EC8ED31\u0026gwt=pay) that RSS is a “not particularly user friendly” acronym coined by “computer geeks.” Before the RSS icon was designed in 2004, websites like the _New York Times_ [linked to their RSS feeds using little orange boxes labeled](https://web.archive.org/web/20050326065348/www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html) “XML,” which can only have been intimidating. The label was perfectly accurate though, because back then clicking the link would take a hapless user to a page full of XML. [This great tweet](https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008) captures the essence of this explanation for RSS’ demise:\n\nRegular people never felt comfortable using RSS; it hadn’t really been designed as a consumer-facing technology and involved too many hurdles; people jumped ship as soon as something better came along.\n\nRSS might have been able to overcome some of these limitations if it had been further developed. Maybe RSS could have been extended somehow so that friends subscribed to the same channel could syndicate their thoughts about an article to each other. Maybe browser support could have been improved. But whereas a company like Facebook was able to “move fast and break things,” the RSS developer community was stuck trying to achieve consensus. When they failed to agree on a single standard, effort that could have gone into improving RSS was instead squandered on duplicating work that had already been done. Davis told me, for example, that Atom would not have been necessary if the members of the Syndication mailing list had been able to compromise and collaborate, and “all that cleanup work could have been put into RSS to strengthen it.” So if we are asking ourselves why RSS is no longer popular, a good first-order explanation is that social networks supplanted it. If we ask ourselves why social networks were able to supplant it, then the answer may be that the people trying to make RSS succeed faced a problem much harder than, say, building Facebook. [As Dornfest wrote](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/syndication/conversations/messages/1717?guccounter=1) to the Syndication mailing list at one point, “currently it’s the politics far more than the serialization that’s far from simple.”\n\nSo today we are left with centralized silos of information. Even so, the syndicated web that Werbach foresaw in 1999 has been realized, just not in the way he thought it would be. After all, _The Onion_ is a publication that relies on syndication through Facebook and Twitter the same way that Seinfeld relied on syndication to rake in millions after the end of its original run. I asked Werbach what he thinks about this and he more or less agrees. He told me that RSS, on one level, was clearly a failure, because it isn’t now “a technology that is really the core of the whole blogging world or content world or world of assembling different elements of things into sites.” But, on another level, “the whole social media revolution is partly about the ability to aggregate different content and resources” in a manner reminiscent of RSS and his original vision for a syndicated web. To Werbach, “it’s the legacy of RSS, even if it’s not built on RSS.”\n\nUnfortunately, syndication on the modern web still only happens through one of a very small number of channels, meaning that none of us “retain control over our online personae” the way that Werbach imagined we would. One reason this happened is garden-variety corporate rapaciousness—RSS, an open format, didn’t give technology companies the control over data and eyeballs that they needed to sell ads, so they did not support it. But the more mundane reason is that centralized silos are just easier to design than common standards. Consensus is difficult to achieve and it takes time, but without consensus spurned developers will go off and create competing standards. The lesson here may be that if we want to see a better, more open web, we have to get better at working together.\n\n_Sinclair writes about the history of computing on his blog, [Two-Bit History](https://twobithistory.org/).

I was having the time of my life with so much hope for my future.\n\nOne day, completely out of the blue, **I began to feel a strange tickle at the back of my throat.** I ignored it at first, hoping it would go away on its own.\n\nBut it didn’t go away. The tickle became a scratch, and the scratch slowly turned into relentless pain and tension I felt every minute of the day.\n\nI began to see doctor after doctor, looking for an explanation. I did every test, scan, and diagnostic you can imagine ordered by a dozen different specialists. None of them could give me even a clue as to what it was.\n\n**The worst part wasn’t the pain; it was the psychological effects.** The overwhelming preoccupation with this feeling in my body made it impossible to be present and connect with others. I felt like I was cut off from everyone around me, even my most cherished loved ones, unable to explain or share even a hint of my experience.\n\n**It felt like my life was ending before it had fully begun.** And in a way that made no sense, that had no reason or cause. As my symptoms worsened, I fell deeper and deeper into a black hole of despair. My hopes and dreams for my future dwindled to the point that I wasn’t sure it was a future worth having.\n\nEventually, **a neurologist I was seeing gave me a last resort**: a powerful anti-seizure medication called carbamazepine. It is normally used to treat schizophrenia, and would have the effect of numbing sensation throughout my entire body. \n\nI took it without hesitation. That was the depth of my desperation. But every day I took the medication, it felt like I was drunk, and my days passed in a numb blur. \n\nLater on, I discovered **another, undocumented side effect: severe short-term memory loss.** Entire books I read, conversations I had, and trips I took were wiped from my memory like they never happened.\n\nEvery day I was faced with **an impossible choice: to be pain-free or to keep my memories.**\n\nThere was a specific moment when something shifted in me. Sitting in yet another doctor’s office awaiting yet another appointment, I was struck by the realization that I was at a crossroads.\n\nI could continue trusting the experts to figure this out for me. I could walk the conventional path and wait for the medical system to come up with an answer. Or **I could take matters into my own hands.** I could take ownership of my treatment and become the author of my own story.\n\nI stood up abruptly and walked over to the receptionist, and asked for my complete patient record. By then, it was a thick stack of papers from years of appointments and lab tests. I took all of it home and began digitizing it using the scanner at my parents’ house.\n\nOnce all those documents were digital, I could begin to work with them. I could highlight the most important points, rearrange them, and add my own observations alongside advice from my doctors. I could turn all the information and guidance I was receiving from so many sources into practical experiments.\n\n**I became like a scientist of my condition, testing new possibilities empirically to see what worked for me and my situation.** \n\nEventually, I realized that I didn’t have an illness that could be cured with a pill. I learned that it was a _functional condition_ – a breakdown in how a part of my body functioned. I began to use my notes to put in place a series of habits – how I slept, how I ate, how I exercised, and how I took care of my mental health – that together provided enough relief for me to live a normal life.\n\nBut let me tell you: **By that point, I had no interest in living a normal life.** My unwanted adversity had created an unforeseen superpower. I found that I had created something – a cognitive exoskeleton – that amplified and enhanced the capabilities of my mind. \n\n**I started to call it my “Second Brain,” and one after another, I began to use this system in every part of my life.**\n\nI used it in my college studies, graduating with stellar grades and university honors for the first time in my academic career. I used it to successfully apply for the Peace Corps and plan my English lessons for hundreds of eager young Ukrainian students. I used it to land my first professional job back in San Francisco, which introduced me to the world of tech and startups. And finally, I used it to start a business to teach that same system to others.\n\nIt took a long time for this to dawn on me, but what I had created was **a system that could be used to solve almost any problem and accomplish any goal.** I had found a way around the central bottleneck on my potential – my biological mind.\n\nWhat I’ve found is that **if you want to create unusual results, you need to take an unusual path.** \n\nThe standard career advice – work hard, acquire credentials, don’t make mistakes, memorize stuff, _use your head_ – is NOT designed to give you a life of freedom and abundance. You have to step outside the bounds that have been drawn for you by society, the media, and the education system.\n\n**You need what I call an** _**unfair advantage**_ – a capability that few others possess, which gives you options that few others have.\n\nI don’t mean “unfair,” as in playing dirty or being unethical. Not at all. I mean “unfair” as in difficult to copy. I mean a source of leverage that allows you to do more than anyone could reasonably expect while putting in less effort than anyone could reasonably imagine.\n\nIt’s like a secret door when everyone else is waiting in line. A secret trail when everyone is slogging through the mud. While everyone else is competing in a brutal contest of sheer will, you take the path of least resistance and draw on a source of leverage that is, literally, inhuman.\n\nA Second Brain is your unfair advantage! \n\n**Here’s a talk I gave recently at Google about the power of Building a Second Brain.** It’s a great introduction to the concept. \n\nCheck it out here on [YouTube](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/8kuezxddzqf3une52gckhzxzz399/dphehmuqp0q65ksm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g%5Fdj1ZODZHT3RjMUtObyZ0PTExMnM=):\n\n[![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/480x270,slAI5fHqPRuXvQOVYTSPm98oqModLt0qZICpy-uiZvSE/https://functions-js.convertkit.com/playbutton?play=%23FFFFFF\u0026accent=%23f33a11\u0026thumbnailof=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DY86GOtc1KNo%26t%3D112s\u0026width=480\u0026height=270\u0026fit=contain)](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/8kuezxddzqf3une52gckhzxzz399/dphehmuqp0q65ksm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g%5Fdj1ZODZHT3RjMUtObyZ0PTExMnM=)\n\n​  \nBest,\n\nTiago\n\n​  \n​**P.S.

But there’s likely one thing getting in the way. Everyone is different, and I’m curious what that hurdle is for you. \n\nDid something come to mind just now?\n\nIs it a particular distraction or perhaps a lack of time? Maybe it’s feeling overwhelmed or even a sense of laziness? Or perhaps you think you lack the skills and knowledge to get started?\n\nYou can relate, right?\n\nMy advice is simple:\n\nHere’s a little advice for each of the most common reasons for not giving your entrepreneurial goals a fair chance:\n\nTime: You must make the work you’re doing toward building an online business a priority. It doesn’t have to be the #1 priority, but it must be a priority for you to dedicate time to it and honor it intentionally. \n\nDistraction: Prioritize. Even if you have a lot to do, prioritize your to-do list so you focus on the items that have the biggest impact first. Set specific time aside on your calendar to focus on each item and do your best to honor that time.\n\nOverwhelm: Break bigger goals into smaller ones, prioritize so you know what to work on first, and do your best to honor the time you set aside for those items.\n\nMotivation: The consistent solution has an accountability partner or even partners to keep you pushing ahead. No matter what level you’re at in your business, it’s so much easier to keep going when you have others who genuinely understand, rooting for you, and keeping you from giving up on yourself.\n\nLack of skills/knowledge: Repeat after me: You don’t need to know it all. Seriously… You don’t. It’s better that you don’t because you can learn and adjust as you go. This is what I like to call just-in-time learning. \n\nCheck out this free article called [**Mindset for Entrepreneurs: Getting and Staying Motivated**](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu8ov58ddb6up7lxeamhegee0qq/dphehmu0zlo5qrsl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc21hcnRwYXNzaXZlaW5jb21lLmNvbS9ndWlkZS9taW5kc2V0L21pbmRzZXQtbW90aXZhdGlvbi8=).\n\nNo one is alone in allowing struggles in making progress to prevent you from achieving your dream. \n\nWe at SPI are here to help you along the way, no matter what hurdles you may encounter.\n\nWe’ve got your back, and there’s a whole community of people just like you here, too. \n\nWhen you dive into the resources we have available for you, you’ll learn quickly that you’re not alone on this journey.\n\nFor now, check out the resources we linked to above for you.

It's in [classrooms](https://futurism.com/college-student-caught-writing-paper-chatgpt); it's in [political advertisements](https://futurism.com/the-byte/republlications-ai-generated-ad); it's in [entertainment](https://futurism.com/studios-ai-replace-background-actors) and [journalism](https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-errors) and a growing number of [AI-powered content farms](https://futurism.com/content-farms-ai). Hell, generative AI has even been integrated [into search engines](https://futurism.com/google-ai-search-journalism), the great mediators and organizers of the open web. People have [already lost work](https://futurism.com/the-byte/copywriter-fired-chatgpt) to the tech, while new and often confounding [AI-related careers](https://futurism.com/the-byte/netflix-cash-in-ai) seem to be on the rise.\n\nThough whether it sticks in the long term remains to be seen, at least for the time being generative AI seems to be cementing its place in our digital _and_ real lives. And as it becomes increasingly ubiquitous, so does the synthetic content it produces. But in an ironic twist, those same synthetic outputs [might also stand to be generative AI's biggest threat.](https://futurism.com/ai-trained-ai-generated-data)\n\nThat's because underpinning the growing generative AI economy is human-made data. Generative AI models don't just cough up human-like content out of thin air; they've been trained to do so using troves of material that actually _was_ made by humans, usually scraped from the web. But as it turns out, when you feed synthetic content back to a generative AI model, strange things start to happen. Think of it like data inbreeding, leading to increasingly mangled, bland, and all-around bad outputs. (Back in February, Monash University data researcher Jathan Sadowski [described it](https://twitter.com/jathansadowski/status/1625245803211272194) as \"Habsburg AI,\" or \"a system that is so heavily trained on the outputs of other generative AI's that it becomes an inbred mutant, likely with exaggerated, grotesque features.\")\n\nIt's a problem that looms large. AI builders are continuously hungry to feed their models more data, which is generally being scraped from an internet that's increasingly laden with synthetic content. If there's too much destructive inbreeding, could everything just... fall apart?\n\nTo understand this phenomenon better, we spoke to machine learning researchers Sina Alemohammad and Josue Casco-Rodriguez, both PhD students in Rice University's Electrical and Computer Engineering department, and their supervising professor, Richard G. Baraniuk. In collaboration with researchers at Stanford, they recently published a fascinating — though yet to be peer-reviewed — paper on the subject, titled \"[Self-Consuming Generative Models Go MAD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01850.pdf).\"\n\nMAD, which stands for Model Autophagy Disorder, is the term that they've coined for AI's apparent self-allergy. In their research, it took only five cycles of training on synthetic data for an AI model's outputs to, in the words of Baraniuk, \"blow up.\"\n\nIt's a fascinating glimpse at what just might end up being generative AI's Achilles heel. If so, what does it all mean for regular people, the burgeoning AI industry, and the internet itself?\n\n_This interview has been edited for length and clarity._\n\n_**Futurism: So you coined a term for the phenomenon of AI self-consumption: MAD. Can you tell us what that acronym stands for, and what that phenomenon entails?**_\n\n**Richard G. Baraniuk:** So, AI is a big field. Generative AI is one important part, and one that the public has become really aware of lately. Generative models generate or synthesize data. So in ChatGPT a person types in a prompt, then the GPT model synthesizes text to write a response. Or if you're using image generators like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion, you put in a text prompt, and the system generates a digital image.\n\nSo engineers develop these generative models. They're basically a computer program, and the program that needs to be trained. Right? And it needs to be trained with huge amounts of data from the internet. ChatGPT was trained on as much of the world wide web as OpenAI could find — basically everything. DALL-E was similarly trained on as many digital images out on the web that could be found.\n\nAnd the crux is that increasingly, AI models are being trained on not just natural data, or real data sourced from the real world. Now, they're also being trained with data that's been synthesized by other generative models. So consequently, we've entered an age where either wittingly or unwittingly, generative models are increasingly consuming the outputs from other generative models. Some companies are willingly training generative models on synthetic data, particularly when they're in an area where there just isn't enough real data. Some people are unwittingly training on generative models — for example, it turns out that a lot of the big training datasets that are used today for learning actually contain synthetic images generated by other generative models.\n\nWe summarize this in what we call an autophageous loop. That's a technical term that basically just means self-consuming. Maybe think of an animal, not just chasing his tail, but eating his tail. We also like the analogy to Mad Cow Disease — feeding cows to other young cows in an ever-repeating cycle that leads to brain-destroying pathogens. So basically, our work has been studying these self-consuming loops, and understanding when models go MAD, if you will. When bad things happen, and what to do if you don't want bad things to happen.\n\n**_Futurism: Is there a certain threshold where synthetic content starts to cause problems? As you've said, synthetic content is already making its way into AI training sets. But how much synthetic content does it take for a model to go MAD and break down?_**\n\n_**Josue Casco-Rodriguez:**_ It definitely varies from model to model situation to situation.\n\n_**Sina Alemohammad:**_ Let's look at this intuitively. Say you have 1 billion pieces of natural data, and you have one piece of synthetic data. MAD won't happen. But one year later, if you have 1 billion pieces of synthetic data, then definitely it'll go MAD in five iterations. We have found this ratio in Gaussian modeling.\n\n_**Baraniuk:**_ Right. And just to be clear, there absolutely is a threshold for every model. But figuring out for DALL-E versus Midjourney, what the exact balance of real and synthetic data needs to be to keep everything safe and not going MAD, that's still a subject of research. But now the question for these big industrial models is, well, what is it?\n\n_**Futurism: So what are some of the implications for AI companies, then? We could say, ideally, that none of this ever gets into datasets. But that's obviously happened — after all, people are [already using AI to do Mechanical Turk work](https://futurism.com/the-byte/people-automating-responses-train-ai).**_\n\n**_Casco-Rodriguez:_** So when you're unwittingly using synthetic data — that also applies to practitioners, people who are generating images and putting them on the internet — you're probably not going to be conscious of the fact that what you produce is going to be in the future training of generative models. We see this with the dataset [Laion-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), for example, which was used to train Stable Diffusion: generative images that people made in the past are being used to train new generative models. So if people are producing synthetic data, they need to be conscious of this fact. On the company side, your best shot is using something like watermarking to be able to detect synthetic data and maybe remove it.\n\nAs far as when you're knowingly using synthetic data, you need to be conscious that these generative models aren't perfect, and that they oftentimes do things like sacrifice synthetic diversity for synthetic quality. If that's happening in your model, and you're training on it, then you need to be cognizant that that's happening.\n\n_**Baraniuk:**_ Say there are companies that, for whatever reason — maybe it's cheaper to use synthetic data, or they just don't have enough real data — and they just throw caution to the wind. They say, \"we're going to use synthetic data.\" What they don't realize is that if they do this generation after generation, one thing that's going to happen is the artifacts are going to be amplified. Your synthetic data is going to start to drift away from reality.\n\nThat's the thing that's really the most dangerous, and you might not even realize it's happening. And by drift away from reality, I mean you're generating images that are going to become increasingly, like, monotonous and dull. The same thing will happen for text as well if you do this — the diversity of the generated images is going to steadily go down. In one experiment that we ran, instead of artifacts getting amplified, the pictures all converge into basically the same person. It's totally freaky.\n\n**_Futurism: What are the implications for users of these systems?_** \n\n_**Baraniuk:**_ It's difficult for the users to protect themselves. If these models are being used in a loop like this, unfortunately, from a user perspective, the content they're generating is just going to become increasingly dull. And that's going to be disappointing, right? That's just fact.\n\nSo what can users really do to help the situation? One thing they can do is not turn off watermarking where it exists. There are some downsides to watermarking, but if someone's training a new model, they could seek synthetic images with watermarks and throw them out. That would really help with this threshold effect that we talked about. The second thing that users need to know is that their outputs, if they put them on the web, are going to invariably leak into training datasets for future systems. Some things are just inevitable.\n\n_**Futurism: What are the downsides of watermarking?**_\n\n_**Baraniuk:**_ It intentionally introduces an artifact. And compounded over generations, those can blow up like the AI-generated images in our paper.\n\n_**Alemohammad:**_ Yeah, the problem is unknown. We don't know how the watermark can or will be amplified. But definitely, the benefits outweigh the downside. Right now, watermarking is the solution that we need to find synthetic data.\n\n_**Futurism:** **AI is already being integrated into services throughout the internet, most notably search engines. And search engines, to some capacity, are how we do almost everything online — they're central to the mediation and navigation of the web. Are you at all concerned about the future of the web's usability, if generated AI models are integrated into the web and into our daily lives, and then start to degrade because they keep swallowing synthetic material?**_ \n\n_**Baraniuk:**_ This a really important long-term question. There's no question that MADness has the potential to significantly reduce the quality of the data on the internet. Just the quality of the data. And our work in this particular paper hasn't really dealt with the kind of AI systems used, let's say, in search engines. So it's a bit too early to tell. But there is some other work out there that actually shows that if you train a different, non-generative AI system — some other kind of AI system like the kind used in search engines — if you train that AI system using synthetic data in addition to real data, performance actually goes down.\n\nSo this supports the hypothesis that the more synthetic data that's out there, it could actually lower the performance of a whole host of tools, search engines included, that are trained on all of this data out there on the internet — some of which is real, but some of which is synthetic. Folks are starting to connect those dots.\n\n**_Casco-Rodriguez:_** One thought I've had is that the ping-ponging back and forth between models can be really freaky. And since generative AI is already being used to do things like generate websites entirely, you could wind up having generative models leading you to results that are also synthetic, that have hyperlinks to other synthetic websites. There could be a whole synthetic ecosystem that you find through search engines, which is kind of crazy.\n\n_**Baraniuk:**_ Yeah, you'd get trapped in that world. It connects back to how people are using ChatGPT to do Mechanical Turk work. In order to do supervised learning — which is one of the big ways people learn from data to build these kinds of models — you need to label data. This kind of data annotation has been the gold standard, but now they're finding that when you put these labeling tasks out on a service like, say, Mechanical Turk, people aren't doing it anymore. They're just asking AI systems to do the labeling for them. It's more efficient, but it puts us exactly in another one of these loops we've been talking about. Loops upon loops.\n\n_**Futurism:**_ Snake eating its tail.\n\n_**Baraniuk:**_ No question. Again, it's this idea of loops on top of loops, and that can make it extremely hard to ultimately track down the source of where any problems in AI models are coming from.\n\nA quick story there: the whole jumping off point for our research happened when one of our group members was at a conference presenting a poster — not on this stuff, but on related work — and there was a researcher from industry who walked by who, just offhandedly, remarked that pretty soon, there's gonna be more synthetic images on the internet than real images. This was about a year and a half ago, and he said that there are going to be more synthetic websites than real websites. There's going to be more fake text than real text.\n\n**More on AI:** [_AI Developers Are Already Quietly Training AI Models Using AI-Generated Data_](https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-synthetic-data)\n\n  \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.368561991Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Omnivore/2023-08-12/elvis-on-Twitter-Just-came-across-this-on-arXiv.-An-awesome-book-on-graph-theory.-If-you-are-i...":{"title":"elvis on Twitter- Just came across this on arXiv.

With that said, I’m about to share with you the #1 struggle most people responded with, and it’s probably one you have experienced in some capacity, too. \n\nI know I have. \n\nWhat is it?\n\n**Too many distractions and procrastination.** \n\n![Too many distractions 35.9%; Not enough time 23.2%; I'm too overwhelmed 19.6%; I'm missing some knowledge or key skills 15.4%; I can't get motivated 5.8%](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/570x0,shrSkoZiawK2zaWGpWz_xqpJ_wMmv4r4oxkhHWuOECNY/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/bXy9qJJZ74AD9RcM9kraEq/r3KSvw86qg735gmc85JXKc/email)\n\nAs you can see, nearly 40 percent of respondents have told us that distractions are their biggest challenge. It’s a constant battle most people have when trying something new and stepping outside of their comfort zones. \n\nIn Stephen Pressfield’s book, _The War of Art_, he talks about the self-sabotage we bring upon ourselves as creatives when things start to get tough. \n\nCreating something is like growing a tree. The bigger the tree we try to grow, the larger the shadow that comes along with it. \n\nBut self-doubt, and the fear that comes along with it, is a sign that there’s something great on the other end. \n\nIt’s a test to see how much you want it, and you can pass by learning to focus and prioritize your work toward the goal… or you can fail by giving up.\n\nIf you’re dealing with procrastination right now, here are two tips:\n\n1. F.O.C.U.S. = Follow One Course Until Success. We all tend to say yes to or try too many things at once. Trust me, I did it too. But I’ve learned that less is more in online business. Pick one thing, focus on it, learn as you stumble forward, and actually give it a chance to succeed. Spread yourself too thin, and nothing will even have a chance to succeed.\n2. Prioritize. Even if you have a lot to do, prioritize your to-do list so you focus on the items that have the biggest impact. Set specific time aside on your calendar to focus on each item and do your best to honor that time. I call this “time-blocking,” and it’s absolutely the best way to get things done and keep boundaries around your commitments.\n\nLastly, the best thing you can do is surround yourself with other people like you. People who are set on achieving the same goals. That's why we ask everyone new here the question about the type of business that they run.\n\nAnswer it here **⤵**\n\n​\n\n**What kind of business do you have, or are looking to start?** \n\nAnswering this question helps us tailor the advice we send you to your business needs. \n\n​\n\nIt's like going to the gym—it's hard, but when you go with other people, it becomes much easier, and the results come much faster. \n\nThis is exactly why SPI is here. \n\nIt’s a community of entrepreneurs who can come together to find support and get the accountability needed to get through the toughest of moments and the hardest of struggles. \n\nYou can’t do this alone.

Generate Utils File\n\nIn the `reverie/backend_server` folder (where `reverie.py` is located), create a new file titled `utils.py` and copy and paste the content below into the file:\n\n```ini\n# Copy and paste your OpenAI API Key\nopenai_api_key = \"\u003cYour OpenAI API\u003e\"\n# Put your name\nkey_owner = \"\u003cName\u003e\"\n\nmaze_assets_loc = \"../../environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets\"\nenv_matrix = f\"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/matrix\"\nenv_visuals = f\"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/visuals\"\n\nfs_storage = \"../../environment/frontend_server/storage\"\nfs_temp_storage = \"../../environment/frontend_server/temp_storage\"\n\ncollision_block_id = \"32125\"\n\n# Verbose \ndebug = True\n\n```\n\nReplace `\u003cYour OpenAI API\u003e` with your OpenAI API key, and `\u003cname\u003e` with your name.\n\n### Step 2\\. Install requirements.txt\n\nInstall everything listed in the `requirements.txt` file (I strongly recommend first setting up a virtualenv as usual). A note on Python version: we tested our environment on Python 3.9.12.\n\n## [![Generative Klaus](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,seEWL0pfX_gP2Rm7VanCDE6wOSXtkl08cS8BzSvhu_1g/https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d2f0842910c93751efe0f7b34c41c4cea8e228f6392f117136cec9e87f88fc/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4b6c6175735f4d75656c6c65722e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d2f0842910c93751efe0f7b34c41c4cea8e228f6392f117136cec9e87f88fc/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4b6c6175735f4d75656c6c65722e706e67) Running a Simulation\n\nTo run a new simulation, you will need to concurrently start two servers: the environment server and the agent simulation server.\n\n### Step 1\\. Starting the Environment Server\n\nAgain, the environment is implemented as a Django project, and as such, you will need to start the Django server. To do this, first navigate to `environment/frontend_server` (this is where `manage.py` is located) in your command line. Then run the following command:\n\n```vim\npython manage.py runserver\n\n```\n\nThen, on your favorite browser, go to \u003chttp://localhost:8000/\u003e. If you see a message that says, \"Your environment server is up and running,\" your server is running properly. Ensure that the environment server continues to run while you are running the simulation, so keep this command-line tab open! (Note: I recommend using either Chrome or Safari. Firefox might produce some frontend glitches, although it should not interfere with the actual simulation.)\n\n### Step 2\\. Starting the Simulation Server\n\nOpen up another command line (the one you used in Step 1 should still be running the environment server, so leave that as it is). Navigate to `reverie/backend_server` and run `reverie.py`.\n\nThis will start the simulation server. A command-line prompt will appear, asking the following: \"Enter the name of the forked simulation: \". To start a 3-agent simulation with Isabella Rodriguez, Maria Lopez, and Klaus Mueller, type the following:\n\n```armasm\nbase_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus\n\n```\n\nThe prompt will then ask, \"Enter the name of the new simulation: \". Type any name to denote your current simulation (e.g., just \"test-simulation\" will do for now).\n\nKeep the simulator server running. At this stage, it will display the following prompt: \"Enter option: \"\n\n### Step 3\\. Running and Saving the Simulation\n\nOn your browser, navigate to \u003chttp://localhost:8000/simulator%5Fhome\u003e. You should see the map of Smallville, along with a list of active agents on the map. You can move around the map using your keyboard arrows. Please keep this tab open. To run the simulation, type the following command in your simulation server in response to the prompt, \"Enter option\":\n\nNote that you will want to replace `\u003cstep-count\u003e` above with an integer indicating the number of game steps you want to simulate. For instance, if you want to simulate 100 game steps, you should input `run 100`. One game step represents 10 seconds in the game.\n\nYour simulation should be running, and you will see the agents moving on the map in your browser. Once the simulation finishes running, the \"Enter option\" prompt will re-appear. At this point, you can simulate more steps by re-entering the run command with your desired game steps, exit the simulation without saving by typing `exit`, or save and exit by typing `fin`.\n\nThe saved simulation can be accessed the next time you run the simulation server by providing the name of your simulation as the forked simulation. This will allow you to restart your simulation from the point where you left off.\n\n### Step 4\\. Replaying a Simulation\n\nYou can replay a simulation that you have already run simply by having your environment server running and navigating to the following address in your browser: `http://localhost:8000/replay/\u003csimulation-name\u003e/\u003cstarting-time-step\u003e`. Please make sure to replace `\u003csimulation-name\u003e` with the name of the simulation you want to replay, and `\u003cstarting-time-step\u003e` with the integer time-step from which you wish to start the replay.\n\nFor instance, by visiting the following link, you will initiate a pre-simulated example, starting at time-step 1:  \n\u003chttp://localhost:8000/replay/July1%5Fthe%5Fville%5Fisabella%5Fmaria%5Fklaus-step-3-20/1/\u003e\n\n### Step 5\\. Demoing a Simulation\n\nYou may have noticed that all character sprites in the replay look identical. We would like to clarify that the replay function is primarily intended for debugging purposes and does not prioritize optimizing the size of the simulation folder or the visuals. To properly demonstrate a simulation with appropriate character sprites, you will need to compress the simulation first. To do this, open the `compress_sim_storage.py` file located in the `reverie` directory using a text editor. Then, execute the `compress` function with the name of the target simulation as its input. By doing so, the simulation file will be compressed, making it ready for demonstration.\n\nTo start the demo, go to the following address on your browser: `http://localhost:8000/demo/\u003csimulation-name\u003e/\u003cstarting-time-step\u003e/\u003csimulation-speed\u003e`. Note that `\u003csimulation-name\u003e` and `\u003cstarting-time-step\u003e` denote the same things as mentioned above. `\u003csimulation-speed\u003e` can be set to control the demo speed, where 1 is the slowest, and 5 is the fastest. For instance, visiting the following link will start a pre-simulated example, beginning at time-step 1, with a medium demo speed:  \n\u003chttp://localhost:8000/demo/July1%5Fthe%5Fville%5Fisabella%5Fmaria%5Fklaus-step-3-20/1/3/\u003e\n\n### Tips\n\nWe've noticed that OpenAI's API can hang when it reaches the hourly rate limit. When this happens, you may need to restart your simulation. For now, we recommend saving your simulation often as you progress to ensure that you lose as little of the simulation as possible when you do need to stop and rerun it. Running these simulations, at least as of early 2023, could be somewhat costly, especially when there are many agents in the environment.\n\n## [![Generative Maria](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sF0CwkfgJlIVB6x-7mdxPHQSh908KyIkSchbbeNm8JS0/https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e310b67270995c98d42ff78655a0f2d18be3d0876d2432ecd2b078fa1fc4a541/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4d617269615f4c6f70657a2e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e310b67270995c98d42ff78655a0f2d18be3d0876d2432ecd2b078fa1fc4a541/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4d617269615f4c6f70657a2e706e67) Simulation Storage Location\n\nAll simulations that you save will be located in `environment/frontend_server/storage`, and all compressed demos will be located in `environment/frontend_server/compressed_storage`.\n\n## [![Generative Sam](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sVIaWzX_L2LJKXLqEreTS9OWM3AkeTPc29I_WsbDxPlQ/https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a4635243f8c858a2aed207c8558da6b396d931d240c234b3347c3f6086f1dc27/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f53616d5f4d6f6f72652e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a4635243f8c858a2aed207c8558da6b396d931d240c234b3347c3f6086f1dc27/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f53616d5f4d6f6f72652e706e67) Customization\n\nThere are two ways to optionally customize your simulations.\n\n### Author and Load Agent History\n\nFirst is to initialize agents with unique history at the start of the simulation. To do this, you would want to 1) start your simulation using one of the base simulations, and 2) author and load agent history. More specifically, here are the steps:\n\n#### Step 1\\. Starting Up a Base Simulation\n\nThere are two base simulations included in the repository: `base_the_ville_n25` with 25 agents, and `base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus` with 3 agents. Load one of the base simulations by following the steps until step 2 above.\n\n#### Step 2\\. Loading a History File\n\nThen, when prompted with \"Enter option: \", you should load the agent history by responding with the following command:\n\n```jboss-cli\ncall -- load history the_ville/\u003chistory_file_name\u003e.csv\n\n```\n\nNote that you will need to replace `\u003chistory_file_name\u003e` with the name of an existing history file. There are two history files included in the repo as examples: `agent_history_init_n25.csv` for `base_the_ville_n25` and `agent_history_init_n3.csv` for `base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus`. These files include semicolon-separated lists of memory records for each of the agents—loading them will insert the memory records into the agents' memory stream.\n\n#### Step 3\\. Further Customization\n\nTo customize the initialization by authoring your own history file, place your file in the following folder: `environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets/the_ville`. The column format for your custom history file will have to match the example history files included. Therefore, we recommend starting the process by copying and pasting the ones that are already in the repository.\n\n### Create New Base Simulations\n\nFor a more involved customization, you will need to author your own base simulation files. The most straightforward approach would be to copy and paste an existing base simulation folder, renaming and editing it according to your requirements. This process will be simpler if you decide to keep the agent names unchanged.

(FWIW, she took a lot of heat for it).\n\nNow putting aside that Beyoncé has a supporting team of nearly 100 people, there’s **a kernel of truth here.**\n\nThere is a fixed amount of hours in each day.\n\nWhich means there’s a limit to what can be accomplished by Queens, Kings and ordinary plebes.\n\n## Time management completely misses the mark\n\nNow to deal with these pesky 24 hours, you’ll hear the same advice over and over again.\n\nWake up earlier.\n\nUse a Text Expander.\n\nAutomate paying your bills.\n\nTake cold showers.\n\nYes, the cacophonous choir of **$10 Work.**\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/384x0,sIR9W8Qj2_4fS4Z81pGKmXio-6NOXCBw0hlGbHWla5m0/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/4PBmQFnoxXsiMwVEcwK1qN/email)\n\nYet deep inside, friend you know the truth.\n\n**This won't put a dent in your endless to-do list.**\n\nCommon hustle culture productivity advice got one thing horribly wrong.\n\n**Time Management. just. does. not. work.**\n\nHere's what to do instead.\n\nHere's a simple idea. \n\nOur energy fluctuates throughout the day. \n\nSo why not match your best energy with your most productive activities? \n\nLet me offer myself as a case study.\n\nAs a father of two young kids, I have peak energy right after I wake up, meditate and work out. \n\nAs the morning progresses (and the coffee kicks in), the energy continues to increase. \n\nAround lunch, my full tummy makes me lethargic and my energy starts to wane. \n\nThen at around 3 pm, right as I go for that cookie or Diet Coke, my energy violently plummets.\n\nHere's what this looks like as a graph:\n\n![A graph of energy vs time of day](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/800x0,s5CfrO3xG42qZYGG5f0zENl1J78EKqCmSgKWVfdv0uBA/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/ccG9ieNFEUPhj2AMZYRgVC/email)\n\nEveryone has their own unique Energy Map\n\n**​**\n\n## 4 steps to manage your energy\n\nYo, we are pumped for your shift into energy management.

This is the time to batch your low-value, $10 Work. \n\nPut on some headphones and get to Inbox Zero, pay those bills and reorganize your Notion workspace. \n\n(Heck, we encourage you to even grab our preferred cocktail, a Skinny Margarita.)\n\n**Step 3: Can you** **transform** **your low-energy zones?**\n\nHere’s where it gets spicy, my friend.\n\nWhat separates energy from time? \n\nTime is finite and cannot be replenished. \n\nEnergy is (theoretically) infinite and can be restored. \n\nCan any of your low energy zones **can be flipped into higher-energy zones?**\n\nThis is where you can lean into the other categories and look for triggers and causes. For example:\n\n* The heavy Italian hero you had for lunch could be replaced with a salad with healthy fats (avocados) and protein (fish)\n* Does a certain 1:1 zap you of your energy – can you move it around?\n* When you need a cookie for that afternoon boost, could u swap it with a brisk walk (or some burpees)?\n* Where can batching similar activities remove the friction of context switching?\n\n​\n\n## Your turn!

When they next expected to receive data, they heard nothing at all. The small error almost made humanity lose its connection with the popular spacecraft, which is now 12.4 billion miles from home. Along with its twin, Voyager 1, it is humanity’s farthest-flung spacecraft that is still collecting data.\n\nHere’s what happened: Dodd’s team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had actually spotted the error in the command and corrected it—but then mistakenly sent out the flawed version. “It felt awful. It was a moment of panic, because we were 2 degrees off point, which was substantial,” says Dodd, the project manager of the Voyager interstellar mission.\n\nThe team settled on a solution: Blast a “shout” command in the probe’s direction, telling it to adjust the antenna back toward Earth. If the signal was strong enough, the craft could still receive it, even though its antenna was offset. \n\nOn the morning of August 2, they sent the highest-power signal they could, using the high-elevation, 70-meter, 100-kilowatt S-band transmitter at the communication station in Canberra, Australia. The station is part of NASA’s Deep Space Network, an international system of giant antennas managed by JPL. (Because of Voyager 2’s trajectory, one can only communicate with it via telescopes in Earth’s southern hemisphere.) \n\nThere was no guarantee of success, and it would take 37 hours to see if the solution had worked: The time it would take for their signal to ping the craft, and then—if they were lucky—for a signal from Voyager 2 to ping them back. \n\nThe team spent a sleepless night waiting. And then, relief: It worked. Contact was restored on August 3 at 9:30 pm Pacific time. “We went from ‘Oh my gosh, this happened’ to ‘It’s wonderful, we’re back,’” says Linda Spilker, Voyager’s project scientist at JPL.\n\nHad the attempt failed, the team would have only had a single backup option left: the onboard flight software’s fault protection routine. Multiple fail-safes were programmed into the Voyagers to automatically take actions to deal with circumstances that could harm the mission. The next routine was expected to kick in in mid-October. If it worked, it would have generated a correct pointing command, hopefully adjusting the antenna in the right direction.\n\nThe Voyagers have been flying since the late 1970s—they’re turning 46 in a couple weeks—and as Spilker points out, “that was a two-week period with no science data, the longest period of time without it.” In the 2010s, they crossed the heliopause, the boundary between the solar wind and the interstellar wind. Since then, they’ve been taking data on the edge of the heliosphere, the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields generated by the sun, which interacts in unknown ways with the interstellar medium. \n\nStill, that two-week period without contact didn’t interrupt the team’s scientific work. “The Voyager science isn’t something you need to monitor constantly,” Calla Cofield, a JPL spokesperson, told WIRED via email. “They’re studying this region of space over long distances, so a gap of a few weeks won’t hurt those studies.”\n\nWhile the NASA team managed to restore communications with the beloved spacecraft, it won’t be the last scare. The Voyagers have [aged well past their prime](https://www.wired.com/story/voyager-1-and-2-humanitys-interstellar-envoys-soldier-on-at-45/), and [their dwindling power](https://www.wired.com/story/voyager-2-gets-a-life-extending-power-boost-in-deep-space/) means that their scientific instruments can be run for only a few more years.\n\nThe Voyager probes are powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which work by converting heat from the decay of radioisotope fuel, plutonium-238, into electricity. (Such far-flying spacecraft are typically designed to run on nuclear power, rather than on solar, which doesn’t work that far from the sun.) But the fuel source has been decaying over a long time. To conserve power, the Voyager team has already shut down the heaters for all of the scientific instruments—which, despite that, have continued operating normally. In the coming years, the magnetometer, plasma wave surveyor, and charged particle detector will themselves have to be shut down, one at a time, to ensure a few more years of interstellar science.\n\n“Everybody’s exuberant that we have the spacecraft back,” Dodd says. “It makes me realize that this mission could end anytime, whether there's human error involved, or just because the spacecraft is old and it breaks. It makes you value what you have.”\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.368561991Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Omnivore/2023-08-14/Taking-your-next-steps-forward":{"title":"Taking your next steps forward…","content":"\n# Taking your next steps forward…\n#Omnivore\n\n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/taking-your-next-steps-forward-189f4bc891b)\n[Read Original](https://omnivore.app/no_url?q=3e420311-6750-45a8-b003-219d64757475)\n\n# State\n#Omnivore/inbox\n\n# Content\nHere's the truth, : many people who have started this journey have already turned around and gone the other way. \n\nThey start reading a bit here and there, even listening to a podcast or two, but once they imagine having to actually take some action, they retreat back to where they came from. \n\nBut not you.\n\nYou’re still here.\n\nYou're reading this email and determined to make this work, which means_you pass._\n\n_Pass?

I can wait! \n\n…\n\nGreat, you’re back! \n\nNow that you’re all caught up, let me tell you **the story of the simple quote that changed my life** (and how it can change yours, too). \n\n​\n\nWhen I was 26, I moved to San Francisco for a new job – a Project Analyst position at a small consulting agency in the heart of Silicon Valley. \n\nI quickly immersed myself in the fast-paced world of consulting, jumping to serve the needs of large corporate clients depending on us to advance their innovation efforts.\n\nI worked on projects for the City of San Francisco, AT\u0026T, Columbia University, the French postal service, and Toys “R” Us. **These were some of the most interesting experiences of my life,** introducing me to countless new ideas, approaches, and ways of thinking and working.\n\nThis was at the beginning of the “coworking space” trend, and the agency was located in one of the earliest such spaces in downtown San Francisco. I sat amidst teams from innovative young startups and got to know them over lunch. They introduced me to yet another world of “lean startups” and “failing fast” that further transformed how I saw productivity.\n\n**But after about a year, I began to burn out.** I couldn’t handle the long workdays, the last-minute urgent client requests, and the frenetic pace of communication with people across many time zones. I saw that something needed to change.\n\nIt was around this time that I first started reading books on “personal productivity.” I picked up _Getting Things Done_ by David Allen after seeing it on a friend’s bookshelf. On one of the first pages, I encountered a quote that changed my life:\n\n_**“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”**_\n\nOnce it sunk in, I realized this was the complete opposite of everything I had ever been taught. School had taught me to memorize facts and regurgitate them on command. College had taught me to “use my head” and spend countless hours cramming from textbooks. The workplace had taught me to do “brainstorms” and think of “good ideas” at the drop of a hat.\n\nI had always had a good imagination, fueled by my extensive reading. But I also had a terrible memory and was never very quick on my feet, which led me to think I was stupid. The way my mind worked didn’t seem to fit any of the traditional definitions of intelligence I was presented with.\n\n**This quote taught me a new way of looking at my own brain: as a generator of new thoughts and ideas** while leaving the job of preserving them to someone else. \n\nI was finally discovering that my brain wasn’t meant to remember things. It was meant to imagine, to wonder, to dream, to run after spontaneous interests without a care in the world.\n\nI took this new attitude back to my job, and **it soon transformed the way I worked.**\n\nEvery email I sent to a colleague, every presentation for my team, every brief sent to a contractor, and every client proposal – I began to see each of these artifacts as evergreen building blocks that I could collect and reuse over time.\n\nAnd as I began working with these building blocks, I had another epiphany: **a modern piece of work isn’t created from scratch; it’s assembled.**\n\nIf we committed to creating a new website, we would always begin by assembling all the needed material: photos, text, colors, graphics, calls to action, links to other sites, and interactive elements. It made no sense to begin building the website until most of these pieces were ready.\n\nAnd everything we create is like this. Modern work has become so complex and multi-disciplinary that we virtually never sit down to create from nothing. We start by _assembling_ building blocks and only then are we ready to begin putting them together.\n\nEventually, I put in place the third and final piece of the puzzle: if I was going to be creating and assembling these building blocks for the foreseeable future, I needed a pipeline – a place to store and organize my “content” over time. \n\nLike a staging area for ideas, **we all need a trusted place outside our head where the accumulated sum of our past thinking** (plus the thinking of others) can be laid out and prepared for use.\n\nWhere do you think you’re going to find all the building blocks you need if you don’t take the time to assemble them beforehand?\n\nI turned to the digital notes I had been keeping since my medical condition years before and began to expand on that initial use case. I began to save everything that might be useful for future content I might one day create: online research, interesting facts, informative diagrams, evocative photos, customer feedback, and so much more.\n\nYou’re already consuming the equivalent of 30 gigabytes of information every day. All you have to do is divert 1% of that raging river into a little reservoir of your own making. \n\n**That’s your Second Brain: a single, centralized repository of your most valuable knowledge to fuel your future endeavors.**\n\nSo, how do you start building a Second Brain?

When it grows so large that I begin to feel the need to create more internal structure, that is a sign that one large project needs to be broken down into two or three smaller ones.\n\n[![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s72Y-A4zwkl1AefaH4ec_c2QmQzXY1fSX3dQlsczj8wE/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/oP2q5jihy5hj474ZFtvPjw/byAiEQg8gG3dr3uf7kL13S)](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmun82mm8esmh06er82s6hdzdd400/58hvh8umo7x2xof6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g%5Fdj1maW9MaGIxVTRKMA==)\n\n## Implementing the PARA Method in Apple Notes\n\n---\n\nI want to show you another example of what PARA looks like in practice.

We’ve taught podcasting, email marketing, affiliate marketing, webinars, and YouTube.\n\nIt’s been awesome…\n\n…but _a lot_ has changed since 2017.\n\nOnline courses are great, but on their own, they don’t necessarily provide the _best_ value. \n\nIt can be hard to find the time, stay motivated, or feel confident that you have the right information to succeed. \n\nThat's why we created the All-Access Pass. \n\nWe’ve taken the lead in creating **community-powered courses,** a new way for entrepreneurs to accelerate their business growth in less time. **And it’s working.**\n\nWith SPI’s All-Access Pass, you'll get access to our entire course library, a thriving community of like-minded entrepreneurs, and direct guidance from our team of experts—_all for a fraction of the cost of a course alone_. Plus, custom pathways to keep you pushing forward toward your goals. **We'll guide you every step of the way**. \n\nYou’ll get access to workshops like:\n\n* Building your brand\n* Social media 101\n* Creating a business plan\n* How to utilize Google Analytics.\n* And much more\n\nYou’ll also be able to join course accelerators, where you can go through a course with other students at the same time, making the experience even more supportive and engaging.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Not only do we have higher completion rates through our courses, but also testimonials like this:\n\n_I'm sure you're hearing this a million times, but seriously, thank you for putting the AAP together. I've been toying with my idea for a course on developing Internet standards for nearly a year; now I have a solid course outline and the start on a sales page. I hadn't even really thought about a Circle community for introverted bloggers; now I'm collecting email addresses to gauge interest. All this directly coming from signing up for AAP less than two weeks ago. TWO WEEKS! I've done all this in TWO WEEKS! Seriously, couldn't have done it without you and the SPI team. So, thank you!_ \n_​_ \n_Heather F._\n\nIt's easy to talk about what's included, but it's even better to give you a sample of the content.

Imagine if each week you:\n\n* Ensured you were completing the **pesky \"Important, not Urgent\"**\n* Ruthlessly prioritized your **highest-leverage work**\n* Evaluated how you **allocated your time**\n* Achieved peace of mind that you **are on the right track**\n\n**​**\n\nThat, my friend - **is the Weekly Review.**\n\nBut there's a rub. During a recent workshop, we surveyed 80+ RadReaders on this practice. **Only 14% conducted a regular Weekly Review.**\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/350x0,sT7jx6fJkne7mk8SVDiJuIPtDFc6dQaqJof3JuVcFSyo/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/7DMYN9CozUK6ohRk4QAcsB/email)\n\nAnd I get it. It's a hard habit to start. And an even harder one to maintain.\n\nI fall off the wagon all the time.\n\nBut here's what I've learned about Weekly Reviews in the past decade of coaching and teaching high-performing knowledge workers:\n\n**You make the process too complicated.**\n\nI want to introduce you to a framework that is deceptively simple.\n\nA framework that works. \n\n**And that can be completed in less than 25 minutes.**\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/400x0,sdLVg6dGEj0X3u0T1y3MvnwOBLRUZIgJLSZv4fuYkT3Q/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/tkkdJfrwkGCcmadUfKWRDT/email)\n\n​  \n(And I know a thing or two about the practice.

You can fine-tune on the documentation itself (but results won't be conversational), use embeddings (risks losing relevant context), etc. `gpt-oracle-trainer` is an experimental tool that aims to simplify this process and potentially produce better results.\n\n**Simply provide your product or service's documentation, describe your product or service, select a temperature for data generation, and choose the number of training examples to generate per document. The system will then generate the dataset in the correct format, train the model, and allow you to test it.**\n\n## Features\n\n* **Data Generation**: The system generates a question-and-answer dataset based on your documentation, service description, temperature, and number of examples. The data is formatted correctly for model training.\n* **Model Training**: The system trains the model using the generated dataset.\n* **Model Testing**: Test the trained model with a custom prompt.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. [Open the notebook in Google Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xB0ZeiBAF78FAxNCz-TeRRwQtmmVjxOh?usp=sharing)or in a local Jupyter notebook.\n2. Add your OpenAI API key to the line `openai.api_key = \"OPENAI API KEY HERE\"`.\n3. Paste your documentation into the `docs` list, each document as a separate string.\n4. Define your `service_name_and_description`, `temperature`, and `number_of_examples_per_doc`. For example:\n\n```ini\nservice_name_and_description = \"MosaicML, a platform that makes it easier to train and fine-tune large AI models\"\ntemperature = .7\nnumber_of_examples_per_doc = 10\n\n```\n\n1. Run the cells to generate the dataset, train the model, and test it.\n2. The final trained model will be saved under the name you specify in `new_model`.\n\n## Contributions are welcome! Some ideas:\n\n* improve the data generation process\n* add more customization options for the model training\n\n## License\n\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-oracle-trainer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\n## Contact\n\nMatt Shumer - [@mattshumer\\_](https://twitter.com/mattshumer%5F)\n\nProject Link: [https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-oracle-trainer](https://t.co/mshumer/gpt-oracle-trainer/blob/main/url)\n\nLastly, if you want to try something even cooler than this, sign up for [Personal Assistant](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/personal-assistant) (most of my time is spent on this).

As her podcast grew in popularity, so did her passion for helping others learn about indoor gardening. She saw an opportunity to turn her hobby into a business and took it.\n\nIt wasn’t “push-button” easy, though—it never is. \n\nHere are four specific challenges Maria faced while she was building her business. I’m sure you can relate.\n\n1. **Finding the right target audience:** Maria had to go through trial and error to find the ideal audience for her podcast, _Bloom \u0026 Grow Radio_. Initially, she targeted plant lovers but soon realized that her audience was made up of plant _killers_ who wanted to learn how to keep their plants alive.\n2. **Monetizing:** Initially, Maria had no plan to monetize her podcast, but she eventually realized it was possible through sponsorships and affiliate marketing. However, it took time and effort to build up her audience before she could attract sponsors.\n3. **Time management:** As a solopreneur, Maria had to juggle multiple tasks, including recording, editing, and promoting her podcast, as well as managing her online store.\n4. **Overcoming self-doubt:** Maria had moments of self-doubt and imposter syndrome, where she felt she wasn't qualified to host a podcast or run a business. She had to overcome these feelings and remind herself that she had valuable knowledge and experience to share with her audience.\n\nDo any of those sound familiar to you? \n\nIf yes, then you’re in the right place.\n\nMaria, and people like her, are a part of the SPI community, and we’d love for you to join us.\n\nWith theAll-Access Pass, you’ll have access to all the courses you need, custom-created pathways to get the most out of them, and most importantly, **access to our team of experts and a community of like-minded entrepreneurs** to help keep you inspired and hold you accountable.\n\nWe’re all more likely to succeed when we do it together, which is precisely why our **community-powered courses** are the best solution to overcoming obstacles on your way to a successful business. \n\nMaria’s story is an inspiration to anyone who has ever dreamed of starting their own business. Anything is possible with dedication, grit, and a little bit of help from a supportive community.\n\nWe’re excited to become a guide in _your_ success story too!\n\nCheers,\n\n— Pat  \nP.S.

The kinds of knowledge that they sacrificed and bled for is accessible to us through mere flicks of our fingers.\n\nThe smartest, most influential people in the world are online now. And they’re sharing their most intimate stories and secrets. They’re letting you into their thinking and their work via their writing, podcast interviews, and case studies. \n\n**It’s all available to you 24/7\\. What are you doing about it?**\n\nAre you taking advantage of humanity’s greatest cultural flowering since the Renaissance? Are you part of the greatest intellectual awakening since the Enlightenment? Are you part of this remarkable transformation in human consciousness – the Internet – or are you merely a spectator or victim of it?\n\n**The Internet is the biggest shift in recorded history.** It has already changed every aspect of society, and its influence is only beginning to be felt.\n\nThat shift has opened up countless windows of opportunity for everyone on the planet. Every single day, there are trends, organizations, ideas, and paradigms rising and falling, each of them like an ocean swell you could ride to unbelievable heights.\n\n**That is, as long as you have the right tools and the right mindset.**\n\nThe truth is: As promising and exciting as the Internet tidal wave is, very few people are prepared to ride it. Very few have a way to take in all that information, curate and filter it, and save the parts they want to consume in a trusted place away from the control of any other person or corporation.\n\nLet’s look at the situation honestly. \n\n**Is your current approach to managing information viable for the life you’re trying to lead?** Is it sustainable? If it keeps going how it’s been going, what kind of future is that going to lead you to?\n\nThe research tells us that the amount of information we’re expected to create, capture, copy, and consume will not only increase in the future – it will increase [exponentially](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zupr3mmrvb7u8z226ixh3533l77/qvh8h8u8knvg4efl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdGlzdGEuY29tL3N0YXRpc3RpY3MvODcxNTEzL3dvcmxkd2lkZS1kYXRhLWNyZWF0ZWQv).\n\n[![Volume of information created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/550x0,syopcOq2bYo1X7ZpvOwF3Honyw3XIS8IdtyOJxtaBAPg/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/oP2q5jihy5hj474ZFtvPjw/kUUTRD6BdgBHYMTYEURXH9/email)](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zupr3mmrvb7u8z226ixh3533l77/qvh8h8u8knvg4efl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdGlzdGEuY29tL3N0YXRpc3RpY3MvODcxNTEzL3dvcmxkd2lkZS1kYXRhLWNyZWF0ZWQv)\n\nVolume of information created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide\n\n​\n\nThe Internet was supposed to empower us with the world’s knowledge, but instead, the deluge of data is just overwhelming. Information Overload is a thing of the past. What we are experiencing now is Information _Exhaustion_.\n\n**Information Exhaustion is when our exposure to the chaos and uncertainty of too much information begins to take a toll on our mental, emotional, and physical health.**\n\nEverything we think and feel is ultimately based on information we sense from the outside world, and that world is increasingly filled with noise, fear, and controversy. \n\nOur minds and bodies were not made for this.\n\nThe result is a constant anxiety at the onslaught of new details we have to pay attention to and manage. It is sleepless nights as our minds spin with unprocessed thoughts from days packed to the brim with activity. It shows up when our minds drift in the middle of conversations to all the stuff we have to do. It is the constant state of unease and restlessness, always wondering what unfinished task is slipping through the cracks of our fragmented attention.\n\nIt’s time for us to upgrade our Paleolithic memory. **It’s time to acknowledge that we can’t “use our head” to store everything we need to know. It’s time to outsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines.** \n\nWe have to recognize that the cognitive demands of modern life increase every year, but we’re still using the same brains as two hundred thousand years ago when modern humans first emerged on the plains of East Africa.\n\nNo one is immune to the tsunami of Information Exhaustion. No one will escape the need to upgrade their memory and cognition. **Whether you’re still in school, well into your career, or already retired, it’s time to make a change.**\n\nHere’s what I heard recently from a college student struggling to keep his head above water:\n\n_“My files, thoughts, and ideas are a mess…Everything gets lost in sticky notes, emails I send myself in the middle of the night, notebooks that get filled up and set aside for a time that never comes, and more. In the end, I need to get going as I’m drowning in great ideas that are critical for my destiny.”_\n\nSound familiar?\n\n**I’ve encountered these challenges my entire life.** \n\nYet, I’ve always known deep in my heart that there must be a better way to not only deal with information but make it work for you. \n\nAnd over years of painstaking research and trial and error, **I found better ways that allowed me to thrive.**\n\nNow, my goal is to help you resolve these challenges for yourself without having to go through everything I did. To enable you to improve how you work to make it more fulfilling and impactful.

After the platform was ~~[bought](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-twitter-set-accept-musks-best-final-offer-sources-2022-04-25/)~~ ~~[not bought](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/technology/elon-musk-twitter.html)~~ [bought](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html) by Elon Musk for $44 billion last year, Elon enacted sweeping changes to the company's [staffing](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/11/04/twitter-temporarily-closes-offices-as-elon-musk-begins-mass-layoffs), [content moderation](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139822833/twitter-covid-misinformation-policy-not-enforced) and [business model](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1139619598/twitter-blue-relaunch), not to mention changes to the culture on the site that may well have been a result of Elon's soft power more than any specific policy decision. But in the middle of these highly contentious actions, one new feature on Twitter grew rapidly in importance, and seems to be beloved by people across the political spectrum: Community Notes.\n\n[ ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s3_bkzfYHyMjz1Uwtbxl3wk_HwcF78WUbnY9pKePSdqI/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/elonnote.png) ](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597170780130852864) \n\nCommunity Notes is a fact-checking tool that sometimes attaches context notes, like the one on Elon's tweet above, to tweets as a fact-checking and anti-misinformation tool. It was originally called Birdwatch, and was first rolled out as a pilot project in January 2021\\. Since then, it has expanded in stages, with the most rapid phase of its expansion coinciding with Twitter's takeover by Elon last year. Today, Community Notes appear frequently on tweets that get a very large audience on Twitter, including those on contentious political topics. And both in my view, and in the view of many people across the political spectrum I talk to, the notes, when they appear, are informative and valuable.\n\nBut what interests me most about Community Notes is how, despite not being a \"crypto project\", it might be the closest thing to an instantiation of \"crypto values\" that we have seen in the mainstream world. Community Notes are not written or curated by some centrally selected set of experts; rather, they can be written and voted on by anyone, and which notes are shown or not shown is decided entirely by an [open source](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes) algorithm. The Twitter site has a [detailed and extensive guide](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction) describing how the algorithm works, and you can [download the data](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/download-data) containing which notes and votes have been published, run [the algorithm](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main/sourcecode) locally, and verify that the output matches what is visible on the Twitter site. It's not perfect, but it's surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of [credible neutrality](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/), all while being impressively useful, even under contentious conditions, at the same time.\n\nAnyone with a Twitter account [matching some criteria](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/contributing/signing-up) (basically: active for 6+ months, no recent rule violations, verified phone number) can sign up to participate in Community Notes. Currently, participants are slowly and randomly being accepted, but eventually the plan is to let in anyone who fits the criteria. Once you are accepted, you can at first participate in rating existing notes, and once you've made enough good ratings ([measured by](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/contributor-scores) seeing which ratings match with the final outcome for that note), you can also write notes of your own.\n\nWhen you write a note, the note gets a score based on the reviews that it receives from other Community Notes members. These reviews can be thought of as being votes along a 3-point scale of `HELPFUL`, `SOMEWHAT_HELPFUL` and `NOT_HELPFUL`, but a review can also contain some other tags that have roles in the algorithm. Based on these reviews, a note gets a score. If the note's score is above 0.40, the note is shown; otherwise, the note is not shown.\n\nThe way that the score is calculated is what makes the algorithm unique. Unlike simpler algorithms, which aim to simply calculate some kind of sum or average over users' ratings and use that as the final result, **the Community Notes rating algorithm explicitly attempts to prioritize notes that receive positive ratings from people across a diverse range of perspectives**. That is, if people who usually disagree on how they rate notes end up agreeing on a particular note, that note is scored especially highly.\n\nLet us get into the deep math of how this works. We have a set of users and a set of notes; we can create a matrix , where the cell  represents how the i'th user rated the j'th note.\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sSg8Rg2TZAr35e-l_RqgzYbzxC2q7o9jT4gsMdYNmJ2c/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/matrix.png)\n\nFor any given note, most users have not rated that note, so most entries in the matrix will be zero, but that's fine. The goal of the algorithm is to create a four-column model of users and notes, assigning each user two stats that we can call \"friendliness\" and \"polarity\", and each note two stats that we can call \"helpfulness\" and \"polarity\". The model is trying to predict the matrix as a function of these values, using the following formula:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s5LZ_N5OXF-8HslTn32fFfFm1SoolZ2r2awg_foiqkYY/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/formula.png)\n\nNote that here I am introducing both the terminology used in the [Birdwatch paper](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/blob/main/birdwatch%5Fpaper%5F2022%5F10%5F27.pdf), and my own terms to provide a less mathematical intuition for what the variables mean:\n\n* μ is a \"**general public mood**\" parameter that accounts for how high the ratings are that users give in general\n* is a user's \"**friendliness**\": how likely that particular user is to give high ratings\n* is a note's \"**helpfulness**\": how likely that particular note is to get rated highly. **Ultimately, this is the variable we care about**.\n* or  is user or note's \"**polarity**\": its position among the dominant axis of political polarization. In practice, negative polarity roughly means \"left-leaning\" and positive polarity means \"right-leaning\", but note that **the axis of polarization is discovered emergently from analyzing users and notes; the concepts of leftism and rightism are in no way hard-coded**.\n\nThe algorithm uses a pretty basic machine learning model (standard [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient%5Fdescent)) to find values for these variables that do the best possible job of predicting the matrix values. The helpfulness that a particular note is assigned is the note's final score. If a note's helpfulness is at least +0.4, the note gets shown.\n\n**The core clever idea here is that the \"polarity\" terms absorb the properties of a note that cause it to be liked by some users and not others, and the \"helpfulness\" term only measures the properties that a note has that cause it to be liked by all**. Thus, selecting for helpfulness identifies notes that get cross-tribal approval, and selects against notes that get cheering from one tribe at the expense of disgust from the other tribe.\n\nI made a simplified implementation of the basic algorithm; you can find it [here](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/community%5Fnotes%5Fanalysis/basic%5Falgo.py), and are welcome to play around with it.\n\nNow, the above is only a description of the central core of the algorithm. In reality, there are a _lot_ of extra mechanisms bolted on top. Fortunately, they are described in the [public documentation](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes). These mechanisms include the following:\n\n* The algorithm gets run many times, each time adding some randomly generated extreme \"pseudo-votes\" to the votes. This means that the algorithm's true output for each note is a range of values, and the final result depends on a \"lower confidence bound\" taken from this range, which is checked against a threshold of 0.32.\n* If many users (especially users with a similar polarity to the note) rate a note \"Not Helpful\", and furthermore they specify the same \"[tag](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes)\" (eg. \"Argumentative or biased language\", \"Sources do not support note\") as the reason for their rating, the helpfulness threshold required for the note to be published increases from 0.4 to 0.5 (this looks small but it's very significant in practice)\n* If a note is accepted, the threshold that its helpfulness must drop below to de-accept it is 0.01 points lower than the threshold that a note's helpfulness needed to reach for the note to be originally accepted\n* The algorithm gets run _even more times_ with multiple models, and this can sometimes promote notes whose original helpfulness score is somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4\n\nAll in all, you get some pretty complicated python code that amounts to 6282 lines stretching across 22 files. But it is all [open](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes), you can download the [note and rating data](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes) and run it yourself, and see if the outputs correspond to what is actually on Twitter at any given moment.\n\n## So how does this look in practice?\n\nProbably the single most important idea in this algorithm that distinguishes it from naively taking an average score from people's votes is what I call the \"polarity\" values. The algorithm documentation calls them  and , using  for _factor_ because these are the two terms that get multiplied with each other; the more general language is in part because of a desire to eventually make  and  multi-dimensional.\n\nPolarity is assigned to both users and notes. The link between _user_ IDs and the underlying Twitter accounts is intentionally kept hidden, but notes are public. In practice, the polarities generated by the algorithm, at least for the English-language data set, map very closely to the left vs right political spectrum.\n\nHere are some examples of notes that have gotten polarities around -0.8:\n\n  \n| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Polarity |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Anti-trans rhetoric has been amplified by some conservative Colorado lawmakers, including U.S. Rep.

It turns out that many of these are either people talking about Brazilian politics in Portuguese or Tesla fans angrily refuting criticism of Tesla, so let me cherry-pick a bit to find a few that are not:\n\n| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Polarity |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| As of 2021 data, 64% of \"Black or African American\" children lived in single-parent families. \u003chttps://datacenter.aecf.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by-race-and-ethnicity\u003e                                                                                                                                     | +0.809   |\n| Contrary to Rolling Stones push to claim child trafficking is \"a Qanon adjacent conspiracy,\" child trafficking is a real and huge issue that this movie accurately depicts.

This suggests that if you apply this algorithm in other cultural contexts, it could automatically detect what their primary political divides are, and bridge across those too.\n\nMeanwhile, notes that get the highest _helpfulness_ look like this. This time, because these notes are actually shown on Twitter, I can just screenshot one directly:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,skzynRL8bE0k2zGR-dUYGT4b2yWKKnBmh50-hAbAGLiI/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/helpfulnote1.png)\n\nAnd another one:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sxptBWuj6PfKq_4f5USXj0lIxzJzH6VPbcQztmlukmgQ/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/helpfulnote2.png)\n\nThe second one touches on highly partisan political themes more directly, but it's a clear, high-quality and informative note, and so it gets rated highly. So all in all, the algorithm seems to work, and the ability to verify the outputs of the algorithm by running the code seems to work.\n\n## What do I think of the algorithm?\n\nThe main thing that struck me when analyzing the algorithm is just how _complex_ it is. There is the \"academic paper version\", a gradient descent which finds a best fit to a five-term vector and matrix equation, and then the real version, a complicated series of many different executions of the algorithm with lots of arbitrary coefficients along the way.\n\nEven the academic paper version hides complexity under the hood. The equation that it's optimizing is a [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree%5Fof%5Fa%5Fpolynomial)\\-4 equation (as there's a degree-2  term in the prediction formula, and compounding that the cost function [measures error squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least%5Fsquares)). While optimizing a degree-2 equation over any number of variables almost always has a unique solution, which you can calculate with fairly basic linear algebra, a degree-4 equation over many variables often has many solutions, and so multiple rounds of a gradient descent algorithm may well arrive at different answers. Tiny changes to the input may well cause the descent to flip from one local minimum to another, significantly changing the output.\n\nThe distinction between this, and algorithms that I helped work on such as [quadratic funding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html), feels to me like a distinction between an **economist's algorithm** and an **engineer's algorithm**. An economist's algorithm, at its best, values being simple, being reasonably easy to analyze, and having clear mathematical properties that show why it's optimal (or least-bad) for the task that it's trying to solve, and ideally proves bounds on how much damage someone can do by trying to exploit it. An engineer's algorithm, on the other hand, is a result of iterative trial and error, seeing what works and what doesn't in the engineer's operational context. Engineer's algorithms _are pragmatic and do the job_; economist's algorithms _don't go totally crazy when confronted with the unexpected_.\n\nOr, as was [famously said](https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1473156331297120256) on a related topic by the esteemed internet philosopher roon (aka tszzl):\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sRJo2q6QL_TkcRVJkfI_yiPd3ICvd7CfmfsPwCxESCKo/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/roontweet.png)\n\nOf course, I would say that the \"theorycel aesthetic\" side of crypto is necessary precisely to distinguish protocols that are [actually trustless](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) from janky constructions that look fine and seem to work well but under the hood require trusting a few centralized actors - or worse, actually end up being [outright scams](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/05/25/stable.html).\n\nDeep learning works when it works, but it has inevitable vulnerabilities to all kinds of [adversarial machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial%5Fmachine%5Flearning) attacks. Nerd traps and sky-high abstraction ladders, if done well, can be quite robust against them. And so one question I have is: **could we turn Community Notes itself into something that's more like an economist algorithm**?\n\nTo give a view of what this would mean in practice, let's explore an algorithm I came up with a few years ago for a similar purpose: [pairwise-bounded quadratic funding](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553).\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,shB7R2uXD0Qib-PJv1tkszoKext3aQPNaduujjq_CUys/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/pairwiseqf.png)\n\nThe goal of pairwise-bounded quadratic funding is to plug a hole in \"regular\" quadratic funding, where if even two participants collude with each other, they can each contribute a very high amount of money to a fake project that sends the money back to them, and get a large subsidy that drains the entire pool. In pairwise quadratic funding, we assign each pair of participants a limited budget . The algorithm walks over all possible pairs of participants, and if the algorithm decides to add a subsidy to some project  because both participant  and participant  supported it, that subsidy comes out of the budget assigned to the pair . Hence, even if  participants were to collude, the amount they could steal from the mechanism is at most .\n\nAn algorithm of _exactly_ this form is not very applicable to the Community Notes context, because each user makes very few votes: on average, any two users would have exactly zero votes in common, and so the algorithm would learn nothing about users' polarities by just looking at each pair of users separately. The goal of the machine learning model is precisely to try to \"fill in\" the matrix from very sparse source data that cannot be analyzed in this way directly. But the challenge of this approach is that it takes extra effort to do it in a way that does not make the result highly volatile in the face of a few bad votes.\n\nOne thing that we could do is analyze whether or not the Community Notes algorithm, as is, actually manages to fight polarization _at all_ \\- that is, whether or not it actually does any better than a naive voting algorithm. Naive voting algorithms already fight polarization to some limited extent: a post with 200 upvotes and 100 downvotes does worse than a post that just gets the 200 upvotes. But does Community Notes do better than _that_?\n\nLooking at the algorithm abstractly, it's hard to tell. Why wouldn't a high-average-rating but polarizing post get a strong polarity _and_ a high helpfulness? The idea is that polarity is supposed to \"absorb\" the properties of a note that cause it to get a lot of votes if those votes are conflicting, but does it actually do that?\n\nTo check this, I ran [my own simplified implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/community%5Fnotes%5Fanalysis/basic%5Falgo.py) for 100 rounds. The average results were:\n\n```routeros\nQuality averages:\nGroup 1 (good): 0.30032841807271166\nGroup 2 (good but extra polarizing): 0.21698871680927437\nGroup 3 (neutral): 0.09443120045416832\nGroup 4 (bad): -0.1521160965793673\n```\n\nIn this test, \"Good\" notes received a rating of +2 from users in the same political tribe and +0 from users in the opposite political tribe, and \"Good but extra polarizing\" notes received a rating of +4 from same-tribe users and -2 from opposite-tribe users. Same average, but different polarity. And it seems to actually be the case that \"Good\" notes get a higher average helpfulness than \"Good but extra polarizing\" notes.\n\nOne other benefit of having something closer to an \"economist's algorithm\" would be having a clearer story for how the algorithm is penalizing polarization.\n\n## How useful is this all in high-stakes situations?\n\nWe can see some of how this works out by looking at one specific situation. About a month ago, Ian Bremmer complained that a highly critical Community Note that was added to a tweet by a Chinese government official [had been removed](https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1676590373727088647).\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s4pN-RZ1n1DGLlOV_99e1NZ9YI8-WX1mMlbuzKD7HTm8/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/chinanote.png)\n\n_The note, which is now no longer visible. Screenshot by [Ian Bremmer](https://twitter.com/ianbremmer)._\n\nThis is heavy stuff. It's one thing to do mechanism design in a nice sandbox Ethereum community environment where the largest complaint is $20,000 [going to a polarizing Twitter influencer](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html). It's another to do it for political and geopolitical questions that affect many millions of people and where everyone, often quite understandably, is assuming maximum bad faith. But if mechanism designers want to have a significant impact into the world, engaging with these high-stakes environments is ultimately necessary.\n\nIn the case of Twitter, there is a clear reason why one might suspect centralized manipulation to be behind the Note's removal: Elon has a lot of [business interests in China](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musks-business-ties-china-draw-scrutiny-twitter-purchase-rcna26057), and so there is a possibility that Elon forced the Community Notes team to interfere with the algorithm's outputs and delete this specific one.\n\nFortunately, the algorithm is open source and verifiable, so we can actually look under the hood! Let's do that. The URL of the original tweet is \u003chttps://twitter.com/MFA%5FChina/status/1676157337109946369\u003e. The number at the end, `1676157337109946369`, is the tweet ID. We can search for that in the [downloadable data](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes), and identify the specific row in the spreadsheet that has the above note:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sYa5GCYkLHPpuNEutnqpOBkeg5-fr_YtV8ex4FNcINSA/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/commandline1.png)\n\nHere we get the ID of the note itself, . We then search for _that_ in the `scored_notes.tsv` and `note_status_history.tsv` files generated by running the algorithm. We get:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sYKVI0n0Ktdu4Vfcu761kJxioH9UWwecWkPBA0QC9ev4/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/commandline2.png)\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s20Lt_Ic7dUrIuilYxU89c9my02XMP1aIZ4lBpwIhURY/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/commandline3.png)\n\nThe second column in the first output is the note's current rating. The second output shows the note's history: its current status is in the seventh column (`NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS`), and the first status that's not `NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS` that it received earlier on is in the fifth column (`CURRENTLY_RATED_HELPFUL`). Hence, we see that **the algorithm itself first showed the note, and then removed it once its rating dropped somewhat - seemingly no centralized intervention involved**.\n\nWe can see this another way by looking at the votes themselves. We can scan the `ratings-00000.tsv` file to isolate all the ratings for this note, and see how many rated `HELPFUL` vs `NOT_HELPFUL`:\n\n![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sjeJ2HxiDUlH5C6bQou-DUvmD7jWSTuXMfhcoK9EWbJs/https://t.co/images/communitynotes/commandline4.png)\n\nBut if you sort them by timestamp, and look at the first 50 votes, you see 40 `HELPFUL` votes and 9 `NOT_HELPFUL` votes. And so we see the same conclusion: the note's initial audience viewed the note more favorably then the note's later audience, and so its rating started out higher and dropped lower over time.\n\nUnfortunately, the exact story of _how_ the note changed status is complicated to explain: it's not a simple matter of \"before the rating was above 0.40, now it's below 0.40, so it got dropped\". Rather, the high volume of `NOT_HELPFUL` replies triggered one of the [outlier conditions](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes#tag-outlier-filtering), increasing the helpfulness score that the note needs to stay over the threshold.\n\nThis is a good learning opportunity for another lesson: making a credibly neutral algorithm truly _credible_ requires [keeping it simple](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/11/25/central%5Fplanning.html). If a note moves from being accepted to not being accepted, there should be a simple and legible story as to why.\n\n**Of course, there is a totally different way in which this vote could have been manipulated: brigading**. Someone who sees a note that they disapprove of could call upon a highly engaged community (or worse, a mass of fake accounts) to rate it `NOT_HELPFUL`, and it may not require that many votes to drop the note from being seen as \"helpful\" to being seen as \"polarized\". Properly minimizing the vulnerability of this algorithm to such coordinated attacks will require a lot more analysis and work. One possible improvement would be not allowing any user to vote on any note, but instead using the \"For you\" algorithmic feed to randomly allocate notes to raters, and only allow raters to rate those notes that they have been allocated to.\n\nThe main criticism of Community Notes that I have seen is basically that it does not do enough. [Two](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/why-twitters-community-notes-feature-mostly-fails-to-combat-misinformation/) recent [articles](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-twitter-birdwatch-community-notes-misinformation-politics/#xj4y7vzkg) that I have seen make this point. Quoting one:\n\n\u003e The program is severely hampered by the fact that for a Community Note to be public, it has to be generally accepted by a consensus of people from all across the political spectrum.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"It has to have ideological consensus,\" he said. \"That means people on the left and people on the right have to agree that that note must be appended to that tweet.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Essentially, it requires a \"cross-ideological agreement on truth, and in an increasingly partisan environment, achieving that consensus is almost impossible, he said.\n\nThis is a difficult issue, but ultimately I come down on the side that it is better to let ten misinformative tweets go free than it is to have one tweet covered by a note that judges it unfairly. We have seen years of fact-checking that _is_ brave, and _does_ come from the perspective of \"well, actually we know the truth, and we know that one side lies much more often than the other\". And what happened as a result?\n\nHonestly, some pretty widespread distrust of fact-checking as a concept. One strategy here is to say: ignore the haters, remember that the fact checking experts really do know the facts better than any voting system, and stay the course. But going all-in on this approach [seems risky](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/). There is value in building cross-tribal institutions that are at least somewhat respected by everyone. As with [William Blackstone's dictum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s%5Fratio) and the courts, it feels to me that maintaining such respect requires a system that commits far more sins of [omission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%5Fof%5Fomission) than it does sins of commission. And so it seems valuable to me that there is at least one major organization that is taking this alternate path, and treating its rare cross-tribal respect as a resource to be cherished and built upon.\n\nAnother reason why I think it is okay for Community Notes to be conservative is that I do not think it is the goal for every misinformative tweet, or even most misinformative tweets, to receive a corrective note. **Even if less than one percent of misinformative tweets get a note providing context or correcting them, Community Notes is still providing an exceedingly valuable service as an educational tool.** The goal is not to correct everything; rather, the goal is to remind people that multiple perspectives exist, that certain kinds of posts that look convincing and engaging in isolation are actually quite incorrect, and you, yes you, can often go do a basic internet search to verify that it's incorrect.\n\nCommunity Notes cannot be, and is not meant to be, a miracle cure that solves all problems in public epistemology. Whatever problems it does not solve, there is plenty of room for other mechanisms, whether newfangled gadgets such as [prediction](https://manifold.markets/) [markets](https://manifold.markets/) or good old-fashioned organizations hiring full-time staff with domain expertise, to try to fill in the gaps.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nCommunity Notes, in addition to being a fascinating social media experiment, is also an instance of a fascinating new and emerging genre of mechanism design: mechanisms that intentionally try to identify polarization, and favor things that bridge across divides rather than perpetuate them.\n\nThe two other things in this category that I know about are (i) [pairwise quadratic funding](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553), which is being used in [Gitcoin Grants](https://grants.gitcoin.co/) and (ii) [Polis](https://pol.is/), a discussion tool that uses clustering algorithms to help communities identify statements that are commonly well-received across people who normally have different viewpoints. This area of mechanism design is valuable, and I hope that we can see a lot more academic work in this field.\n\nAlgorithmic transparency of the type that Community Notes offers is not quite full-on decentralized social media - if you disagree with how Community Notes works, there's no way to go see a view of the same content with a different algorithm. But it's the closest that very-large-scale applications are going to get within the next couple of years, and we can see that it provides a lot of value already, both by preventing centralized manipulation and by ensuring that platforms that do not engage in such manipulation can get proper credit for doing so.\n\nI look forward to seeing both Community Notes, and hopefully many more algorithms of a similar spirit, develop and grow over the next decade.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T04:15:27.372562078Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Omnivore/2023-08-16/quant-on-X-This-is-such-a-great-read-that-I-have-to-quote-a-part-of-the-book-Basically-if-you...":{"title":"quant on X- -This is such a great read that I have to quote a part of the book- Basically, if you...","content":"\n# quant on X: \"This is such a great read that I have to quote a part of the book: Basically, if you understand a system well and deeply, you don’t have to play by the same rules as everyone else.

Use tools that give you this freedom.\n\n_File over app_ is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.\n\n---\n\nIn the fullness of time, the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.\n\nThe ancient temples of Egypt contain hieroglyphs that were chiseled in stone thousands of years ago. The ideas hieroglyphs convey are more important than the type of chisel that was used to carve them.\n\nThe world is filled with ideas from generations past, transmitted through many mediums, from clay tablets to manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and tapestries. These artifacts are objects that you can touch, hold, own, store, preserve, and look at. To read something written on paper all you need is eyeballs.\n\nToday, we are creating innumerable digital artifacts, but most of these artifacts are out of our control. They are stored on servers, in databases, gated behind an internet connection, and login to a cloud service. Even the files on your hard drive use proprietary formats that make them incompatible with older systems and other tools.\n\nParaphrasing something [I wrote recently](https://obsidian.md/blog/new-obsidian-icon/)\n\n\u003e If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, it’s important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.\n\nYou should want the files you create to be durable, not only for posterity, but also for your future self. You never know when you might want to go back to something you created years or decades ago. Don’t lock your data into a format you can’t retrieve.\n\nThese days I write using an app I help make called Obsidian, but it’s a delusion to think it will last forever. The app will eventually become obsolete. It’s the plain text files I create that are designed to last.

For instance, due books notes belong in Books/? Surely that would clog up Books/ and make it unusable to actually find titles. I can put a subfolder within Books/ such as Books/Notes/. This works well for book notes but then I have to remember that this is where these notes belong. The benefit of categories only applies when the person using the categories is careful to categorize everything- its an all or nothing approach. It would be interesting to simply have no folders and allow structures between notes to function naturally. Perhaps in a perfect world this would occur, but in reality I would be afraid of messy data- the same connecting nodes that reveal patterns by definition blur lines which is difficult for rigid applications such as work or school. \n\nAs a connecting point, true Zettelkasten removes titles as it inherently categorizes the thought.
