I was having the time of my life with so much hope for my future.</p><p>One day, completely out of the blue, <strong>I began to feel a strange tickle at the back of my throat.</strong> I ignored it at first, hoping it would go away on its own.</p><p>But it didn’t go away. The tickle became a scratch, and the scratch slowly turned into relentless pain and tension I felt every minute of the day.</p><p>I began to see doctor after doctor, looking for an explanation. I did every test, scan, and diagnostic you can imagine ordered by a dozen different specialists. None of them could give me even a clue as to what it was.</p><p><strong>The worst part wasn’t the pain; it was the psychological effects.</strong> The overwhelming preoccupation with this feeling in my body made it impossible to be present and connect with others. I felt like I was cut off from everyone around me, even my most cherished loved ones, unable to explain or share even a hint of my experience.</p><p><strong>It felt like my life was ending before it had fully begun.</strong> And in a way that made no sense, that had no reason or cause. As my symptoms worsened, I fell deeper and deeper into a black hole of despair. My hopes and dreams for my future dwindled to the point that I wasn’t sure it was a future worth having.</p><p>Eventually, <strong>a neurologist I was seeing gave me a last resort</strong>: a powerful anti-seizure medication called carbamazepine. It is normally used to treat schizophrenia, and would have the effect of numbing sensation throughout my entire body.</p><p>I took it without hesitation. That was the depth of my desperation. But every day I took the medication, it felt like I was drunk, and my days passed in a numb blur.</p><p>Later on, I discovered <strong>another, undocumented side effect: severe short-term memory loss.</strong> Entire books I read, conversations I had, and trips I took were wiped from my memory like they never happened.</p><p>Every day I was faced with <strong>an impossible choice: to be pain-free or to keep my memories.</strong></p><p>There was a specific moment when something shifted in me. Sitting in yet another doctor’s office awaiting yet another appointment, I was struck by the realization that I was at a crossroads.</p><p>I could continue trusting the experts to figure this out for me. I could walk the conventional path and wait for the medical system to come up with an answer. Or <strong>I could take matters into my own hands.</strong> I could take ownership of my treatment and become the author of my own story.</p><p>I stood up abruptly and walked over to the receptionist, and asked for my complete patient record. By then, it was a thick stack of papers from years of appointments and lab tests. I took all of it home and began digitizing it using the scanner at my parents’ house.</p><p>Once all those documents were digital, I could begin to work with them. I could highlight the most important points, rearrange them, and add my own observations alongside advice from my doctors. I could turn all the information and guidance I was receiving from so many sources into practical experiments.</p><p><strong>I became like a scientist of my condition, testing new possibilities empirically to see what worked for me and my situation.</strong></p><p>Eventually, I realized that I didn’t have an illness that could be cured with a pill. I learned that it was a <em>functional condition</em> – a breakdown in how a part of my body functioned. I began to use my notes to put in place a series of habits – how I slept, how I ate, how I exercised, and how I took care of my mental health – that together provided enough relief for me to live a normal life.</p><p>But let me tell you: <strong>By that point, I had no interest in living a normal life.</strong> My unwanted adversity had created an unforeseen superpower. I found that I had created something – a cognitive exoskeleton – that amplified and enhanced the capabilities of my mind.</p><p><strong>I started to call it my “Second Brain,” and one after another, I began to use this system in every part of my life.</strong></p><p>I used it in my college studies, graduating with stellar grades and university honors for the first time in my academic career. I used it to successfully apply for the Peace Corps and plan my English lessons for hundreds of eager young Ukrainian students. I used it to land my first professional job back in San Francisco, which introduced me to the world of tech and startups. And finally, I used it to start a business to teach that same system to others.</p><p>It took a long time for this to dawn on me, but what I had created was <strong>a system that could be used to solve almost any problem and accomplish any goal.</strong> I had found a way around the central bottleneck on my potential – my biological mind.</p><p>What I’ve found is that <strong>if you want to create unusual results, you need to take an unusual path.</strong></p><p>The standard career advice – work hard, acquire credentials, don’t make mistakes, memorize stuff, <em>use your head</em> – is NOT designed to give you a life of freedom and abundance. You have to step outside the bounds that have been drawn for you by society, the media, and the education system.</p><p><strong>You need what I call an</strong> <em><strong>unfair advantage</strong></em> – a capability that few others possess, which gives you options that few others have.</p><p>I don’t mean “unfair,” as in playing dirty or being unethical. Not at all. I mean “unfair” as in difficult to copy. I mean a source of leverage that allows you to do more than anyone could reasonably expect while putting in less effort than anyone could reasonably imagine.</p><p>It’s like a secret door when everyone else is waiting in line. A secret trail when everyone is slogging through the mud. While everyone else is competing in a brutal contest of sheer will, you take the path of least resistance and draw on a source of leverage that is, literally, inhuman.</p><p>A Second Brain is your unfair advantage!</p><p><strong>Here’s a talk I gave recently at Google about the power of Building a Second Brain.</strong> It’s a great introduction to the concept.</p><p>Check it out here on
